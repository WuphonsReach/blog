Lots of topics that include the word 'guild' in the EverQuest TNZ discussion board (just some highlights):<br /><br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/008980.html">Random guild invites. Why?</a> - I've seen a <i>lot</i> of guilds trying to form in Greater Faydark in the past few weeks (you'll see silly stuff like <i>/ooc Guild X forming, will pay 1pp to anyone who joins</i> - nothing like bribing guild members and creating a guild of beggars).<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/009976.html">Want in a guild??</a> - Random walk-ups asking to join the guild (we probably need a charter and a semblance of an application process guide).<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/010588.html">What guilds do you admire the most on your server?</a> - Perhaps someday our guild will make this listing...<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/011013.html">"casual" players and guilds</a> - someone looking for a 'casual' player's guild (ours is sort of a mix... we have nobody over level 40 that I've seen... Jarthak was level 40, but GNID'd).<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/011470.html">Guilds are they really worth it?</a> - unguilded player with questions about why it's worth being part of a guild<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/010418.html">guilds</a> - Why guilds stay together and why they fall apart (good topics for a charter/application process page).<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/011687.html">guilds</a> - How do I apply to guild X?  Well, um, it varies...<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/010998.html">GUILD ADVICE! </a> - A very good discussion of how to choose a guild...<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/010048.html">Guild Help </a> - A player looking for a guild<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/009491.html">Guild leaders(or officers) I need YOU! </a> - Discussion of why not to start a guild if you've never been in one before (also pointers on why a more detailed charter is better than a less detailed charter).<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/009272.html">A Question about Guilds </a> - Keeping track of members, having a MIA list so we can confirm whether players are still in the guild.<br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/008495.html">guilds</a> - more newbie questions about guilds
