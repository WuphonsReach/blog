First day on the job and almost made it level 4 (came <i>this</i> close).  As a lowly level 1 mage, it's definitely a good idea to stick within running distance of the gate guards for when you pick on something just a little <i>too</i> big (and everything is <i>almost</i> too big at the start).  While you're sitting by the gate resting up your hit points, it's a good idea to talk with the other low level players who are also sitting and resting (in case you need help later on).  I did mainly, kill some things, loot the corpses until my holding slots were full, then went back into town, cashed out, put my money in the bank and came back out to do it again.  For a while, all you can take on are bats and the occasional giant wasp, but once you get close to level 4 you can kill orc pawns, multiple wasps, black wolfs, and decaying skeletons with dispatch (especially if you train in your Piercing skill).<br /><br />So far the Morell-Thule server seems to have plenty of newbies and some higher level characters, but I haven't really ventured out into the wilds yet.  If you see Scronan (a High Elf Wizard), give a yell from Vorish (we spent most of the evening keeping an eye on each other as we went through Level 2 and Level 3).<br /><br />Level 4 and I get my pet! (not sure if I can have multiple pets or not, but at least I can make use of the spells)
