Yes, made it level 5, time to start traveling further afield.  One of the things I must remember <i>not</i> to do is attack faeries or pixies (not worth the faction hit).  Orcs already hate elves, so I really don't have a lot to lose (other than getting designated as "kill-on-sight" or "KoS").  Got a few platinum pieces (pp) in the bank, maybe I'll wander out to the city of Kelethin in the middle of Greater Faydark (home of the wood elves).<br /><br />Been making heavy use of the maps at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQAtlas</a> and the information at <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">Caster's Realm</a>.  It's always a good idea to read up on those who have gone before you (I like some unknowns, but hate not knowing the overall picture of where I am in the world and where I stand on the road-kill continuum).
