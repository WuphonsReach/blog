<h4>EverQuest - Vorish, High-Elf Mage Level 6</h4>
<br />Last Sunday I got killed because I was adventuring by myself along the path from the orc lift to the orc camp in Greater Faydark.  I had already taken on and beaten a Orc Centurion and an Orc Pawn and the next mob was an Orc Centurion that con'd white to me (even fight) so I should have been able to take it on.  I think my tactical mistakes were that my pet had not fully healed yet and instead of casting spells as fast as I could I chose to attempt melee combat to improve my skills (bad choice in this case).  So once the Orc Centurion made short work of my pet (Gekab) and started to work me over it was over in a matter of seconds.

<br />Sigh, the dreaded "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT..." message.  I wonder if that's what we really see when we pass to the other side?
