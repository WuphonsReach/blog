So why EverQuest as my latest gaming interest?  Actually, it's because <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/">PvP</a> mentions it in their storyline every so often (<a href="http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20011009">see today's strip for an example</a>).  My rationalization for allowing myself lots of hours to play it is that since it's a real-time role playing game with dozens or hundreds of people in the same zone as you it's easy to spend lots of time chatting with the other players (so it's more social than locking myself in a room to play Myst, Master of Orion 2, or Black &amp; White).<br /><br />So what are the best resources for the aspiring EverQuest player?  Well, first you should hunt down a copy of the <a href="http://www.ellegon.net/faq.htm">EverQuest Newbie FAQ</a> (this will answer a lot of questions that you'll have when you first open up that EQ box and finish flipping through the not-so-informative manual).  After that you should look at the following web sites:<br /><br /><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">EverQuest: You're in our world now</a> - Sony/Verant's offical web site<br /><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">EverQuest Casters Realm</a> - This is the best site with lots of content, especially for the caster classes.<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">AllaKhazam's Magical Realm</a> - Another very large site devoted to EQ.<br /><a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/">PlanetEverQuest</a> - Actually, I've just stumbled across this one, so I can't say much about it.<br /><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQAtlas</a> - <b>The</b> place to get maps of the various zones and an overview guide of each zone.<br /><a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/">IGN's EQVault</a> - It's okay, but I found it a little thin on content.<br /><a href="http://www.everlore.com/">Everlore</a> - Another site that I'm currently exploring.
