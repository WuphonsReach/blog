Last night was pretty close to power leveling.  I started the evening as a level 9 and made it to within 1 bubble of level 12 by the time I logged off.  The key to this was being in a group with 2-3 other players over by the Minotaur Caves in the Steamfont Mountains.  With 2 druids (one as tank/puller and one as healer) and a magician (me, with a pet to tank with), we pulled fast and furious and all of us gained a level (not much loot though).  Jarius (Wood Elf Druid) made level 13, Posydion (Wood Elf Druid) made level 11, and Charcon (Gnome Wizard) made level 9.  So with about 3 hours of almost non-stop fighting I figure I bubbled up 5-6 bubbles worth of experience (there are 5 bubbles per level).<br /><br />Jarius was the experienced one (he's working on his 9th EQ character), Posydion only had a pair of level 10 or so characters and I'm still working on my first, but Jarius said that Posydion and I both 'group' very well.  (Which is a good way to make a good name for my character and get myself invited into groups later in the game.)<br /><br />I feel bad because I'm leaving Charcon in the dust (he used to be a level ahead), so I think I'll take it easy once I hit level 12 and do some traveling/farming (a.k.a. killing easy critters for certain types of loot and money).  Maybe it's time to go back to Greater Faydark and show those orcs some payback for all the times they did me in.<br /><br />Tonight I'm going to do some more soloing until I get my level 12 spells to try and earn some money to buy additional spells.
