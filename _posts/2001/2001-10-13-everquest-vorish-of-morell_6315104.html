Yeah, made it to level 12 today.  Spent some time soloing before teaming up with Charcon again in order to get up to lvl 12.  Level 12 is pretty important for a magician because we get the "Bind Affinity" spell which allows us to set our "home point" (the spot where we return to after we die or cast the "Gate" spell to return there voluntarily).  This makes it much easier to travel long distances because you can set your bind point to a safe spot near your hunting grounds.<br /><br />At the moment though, I have a splitting headache (where's that bottle of ibuprofen?)...<br /><br />BTW, bro.  Happy Birthday.
