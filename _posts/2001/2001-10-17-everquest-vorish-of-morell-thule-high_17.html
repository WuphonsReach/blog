Uggh, I'm not sure if it was my computer or something between me and the EverQuest servers last night, but I went link dead 4 times in the space of an hour (I'm going to try again in a few minutes to see if it was a temporary problem or if something is hosed on my computer system).  So I didn't get a chance to give my brother his present that I got from the NPC in Kaladim for turning in the ogre heads.<br /><br />On the plus side, by doing the various quests last night (Crushbone Orc Belts, Ogre Heads) I'm within 1 bubble of level 13.  The Ogre Heads were only about 1/4-1/2 bubble of experience, and the 3 backpacks full of Crushbone Belts (24 belts) gave me about 1 1/2 bubbles of experience (okay, but not fabulous).  I still have to take the Basilisk Tongues down to Ak'Anon to try and get experience there.<br /><br />Once I hit level 13, it's going to be very difficult to find things that con blue or even on the continent of Faydwer, so I'm going to have to really start digging into the various nooks and crannies in Steamfont and Butcherblock (or adventure into Crushbone or Lesser Faydark by myself).  Maybe I'll go hunt the Minotaurs in Steamfont or the ogres in Butcherblock.  More likely is that I will be heading to the desert of Ro or exploring the Ocean of Tears.
