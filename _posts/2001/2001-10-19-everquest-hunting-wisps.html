DING! I made level 14 last night, soloing willowisps on the island in <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/erudscrossing.html">Erud's Crossing</a> (between the continent of Odus and the continent of Antonica).  I also looted 7 Greater Lightstones (GLS) that can be turned in for a quest in the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/northernkarana.html">Northern Plains of Karana</a>, I should end up clearing around 8pp per GLS (or about 50-60pp).  I did die once last night as I had a bad pull that end with 4 of the wisps attacking me and my pet at the same time.  I've found that the best way to pull wisps on the island is to stand on the beach by the ogre and wait for the wisps to come to the statue (you can see them coming if you stand on the beach, and you can spot any additionals that might be hanging around).  I usually tagged them with Shock of Blades, then backed up until I was almost to the water (or until the wisp caught up with me).  This would take the fight far enough away from the normal wisp 'flight patterns' so that I wouldn't get additionals jumping in (I consider this to be 'hunting intelligently' not 'cheating' because it uses knowledge of the wisp's movement patterns to avoid problems).  Everything else on the island causes you to lose faction with the merchants, and I wasn't big enough to take on the ogre (a named NPC).  I've also heard that killing the beetles causes nastier stuff to spawn in the middle of the island (but it was perfectly safe for a level 12 character and pet to walk around when I was there, nothing seemed aggresive at all).<br /><br />My brother wants a better axe for his Paladin Dwarf, well here's <a herf="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=axe">Allakhazahm's list of axes</a>.  He has his heart set on the Minotaur Battle Axe, which is one of the best 1HS axes that I've seen listed.  When looking at melee weapons, most people compare the damage vs delay ratio (dly/dmg) and lower ratios are better (I've seen them as low as 2.000 which is supposedly <i>really</i> good).  I've pulled some of the more accessible items (to a dwarf from Butcherblock Mountains):<br /><br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=256">Battle Axe</a> - 1HS, dmg 7, dly 35 (5.000 ratio)<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=259">Forged Battle Axe</a> - 1HS, dmg 7, dly 34 (4.857 ratio)<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=293">Minotaur Battle Axe</a> - 1HS, dmg 8, dly 37 (4.625 ratio)<br /><br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=367">Bronze Two Handed Battle Axe</a> - 2HS, dmg 9, dly 46 (5.111 ratio)<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=379">Two Handed Battle Axe</a> - 2HS, dmg 12, dly 44 (3.666 ratio)<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=386">Two Handed Dwarven Axe</a> - 2HS, dmg 14, dly 43 (3.071 ratio)<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3550">Well Balanced Two Handed Axe</a> - 2HS, dmg 16, dly 48 (3.000 ratio)<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=395">Northman Battle Axe</a> - 2HS, dmg 16, dly 48 (3.000 ratio)<br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=406">Double Bladed Bone Axe</a> - 2HS, dmg 18, dly 48 (2.666 ratio) MAGIC<br /><br />Tonight's plan is to walk to N Karana and turn in my GLS for the reward.  This will not be a walk in the park to get there either.  The <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/westernkarana.html">Western Plains of Karana</a> and the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/northernkarana.html">Northern Plains of Karana</a> are both moderately dangerous, so I make make the trip by casting invisible on myself.  Both zones have monsters that start around level 4 or level 10 and go up past level 30.  So I'm not planning on doing any hunting on this trip (unless I get a local guide).<br /><br /><i>Vorish of Morell-Thule, High Elf Mage lvl 14</i>
