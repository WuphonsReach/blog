I don't think my brother understands that I did think it was humorous that I died deep in the depths of Blackburrow by biting off more than I could chew (2 greens and 2 blues).  But there's also the challenge aspect of EQ, some situations are difficult and very rewarding once you overcome them (like getting my body back out of Blackburrow and gating my way home).  If it had been really hairy, I'd have been forced to recruit help from other people that I've met over the past few weeks, or hire some local talent (either way it would have fit right in line with what EQ is about).  Still, with the long difficult corpse run, it was very gratifying to finish, hit the gate spell, click my heels three times and whistle "there's no place like Qeynos..." (almost a mini-quest).<br /><br />My last entry was more of "here's where the game changes for a magician class" and I haven't played enough in the new demands (as it gets more difficult) to decide whether it's and adventure and still fun.  Eh, I'm probably not explaining myself at all very well, so suffice it to say that if EQ isn't fun, I probably won't play.  But playing easy games that are just fun and not challenging lacks the rewarding feeling of taking down that difficult pull where you got more than you wanted but were still able to take control of the situation (or even the fun of getting out by the skin of your teeth, or not).<br /><br />And no, I haven't played EQ since Sunday (had too much to do and I'm out of town)...
