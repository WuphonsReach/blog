Sunday I was sick, so I didn't play much and wasn't in the mood for anything stressful when I did.  I logged on and hunted in N Karana for a bit, then headed back to Qeynos to work on my first tradeskill (brewing) that I need to research a few of my spell components.  <br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/pics/Games/EverQuest/Antonica/Blackburrow/EQ000001-Blackburrow-TrainWatchDuty.JPG"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/pics/Games/EverQuest/Antonica/Blackburrow/thumb150/EQ000001-Blackburrow-TrainWatchDuty.JPG" width="150" height="113" border="1" alt="Blackburrow, home of the gnolls, I'm on train watch duty trying to save players from trains." align="left"></a> Sunday evening I went back to Blackburrow to work on faction and good will.  In fact, I made another friend, Iyenu (Erudite Necromancer, lvl 12) by providing support, summoned bandages.  Some of the trains were pretty bad on Sunday night, I had to zone once or twice to get away from the 8-12 angry gnolls who were left behind by someone who got chased across the zone boundary (without yelling TRAIN! to give us time to prepare to defend ourselves).  Most trains in Blackburrow can be beaten down if everyone stays in the zone and stands their ground, but a pair of casters can't beat down a train of that size by themselves (we need melee classes to keep the gnolls busy while we burn them down).  One more mid level character, or if 2 of the lower level characters had stood their ground we would have made it without zoning.  <br /><br />After that I walked up to Halas (way up north) to look for tradeskill supplies and to look around.<br /><br /><i>Vorish of Morell-Thule, High Elf Mage lvl 16</i>
