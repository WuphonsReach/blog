For those of you who think it's okay to stop and smell the roses in Lesser Faydark (or to go look at the little gnomish buildings just inside the zone boundary), here is a reminder that there are some nasty things in those woods.  I was simply on my way from Greater Faydark to the Steamfont mountains, feeling pretty confident, so instead of hugging the wall as usual I was cutting straight across the zone.  I was just about the to Steamfont zone entrance when I decided to take a quick look and see the little gnomish outpost by the entrance.  Heh, silly mage.  I got jumped by Thistle Underbrush (a very high level brownie).  Not having my pet out, I immediately high tailed it for the zone border just a few dozen steps away (okay, so I run from anything that's willing to attack me if I don't have a pet cast).  I was into the gorge to the zone point (just a few steps away) when I got snared (a spell that keeps you from moving) and Thistle was still beating on me.  He hit me for 29 and 52 then snared me twice for 35.  Amazingly, I managed to get the gate spell off and I popped back to the orc lift in Greater Faydark.  Unfortunately, he had cast a DoT (damage over time) spell on me, so my health continued to drop from 40 percent down to 0.  Since I was still snared, I wasn't able to move from my bind point and it made for a <i>very</i> short corpse run.<br /><br /><i>Vorish of Morell-Thule, High Elf Mage lvl 17</i>
