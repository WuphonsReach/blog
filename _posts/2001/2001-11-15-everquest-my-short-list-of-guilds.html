Okay, starting to think about getting guilded now that I'm coming up on my 2 month into EQ date.  I've been looking for a list of guilds on the Morrel-Thule server and the best listing that I've found is <a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/browse_server.cfm?id=29">Guild Magic</a>.  The following list of guilds is just my own personal 'starting' list, some guilds I just liked the name, or thought they had a nice mix of player levels, or I've seen them in action.  Some guilds were mentioned on the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/server.html?eserver=16">Allakhazam's Morell-Thule</a> server board discussion.  There's also the <a href="http://links.allakhazam.com/pages/Everquest/Guilds/Morell-Thule/">Allakhazam's list of guild links</a> for Morell-Thule.<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=941">Avatars of the Ancients</a> (<a href="http://eq-avatars.hypermart.net">web site</a>) They seem to just be getting off the ground, but I've had good dealings with Felweniel before so it might be a good guild to get into (I'll feel like I have strengths to bring to the table and the guild is young enough to be very flexible).  They have not even done a raid yet or a dungeon crawl (other than Crushbone that I know of).  This guild is still at the top of my list (little do they know) because I know one of the players and I think it would be good to see a guild 'get off the ground'.<br /><br />Echelon (<a href="http://www.everquestguild.com">web site</a>) Um, actually I'm not that taken with this guild at the moment (not for any specific reason, just the way some stuff is written up in the rules and regulations section).<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=879">Elven Elite</a> (<a href="http://www.elvenelite.com/">web site</a>) Hey, I'm a high elf!  Actually, this looks like a pretty high-end and highly structured guild and my brother (who plays a dwarf) would be a poor fit due to race.<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=2719">Guardians of Truth</a> (<a href="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/guardians">web site</a>) A moderate aged guild that seems to be actively managed.<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=3120">Nectar of Isolation</a> (no web site) A moderately young guild, with lots of wizards, druids, and rangers.<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=2177">Random Acts</a> (<a href="http://www.eqrandomacts.com/">web site</a>) I like their attitude and it's one of the bigger guilds on Morell-Thule (could be bad, but they have a pretty rigorous pledge process).  I've always heard good things about this guild in various message boards.<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=2613">Tolkien's Revenge</a> (<a href="http://www.pwshift.com/tr/">web site</a>) This is an upper level guild (lowest player I think is level 20) that's caught my eye on occasion.  Supposedly, you have to be a level 35 or better to get in.  Well, maybe someday...<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=1056">Trampers Trade</a> (<a href="http://www.plahfeeg.com/tt/">web site</a>) This guild caught my eye because of the emphasis on trading skills (which I'm currently working on).  There's not a lot of information on their web site other than 'promote tradeskills' and I've never met any of the players.<br /><br /><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=3600">Wind of Fates</a> (<a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/bwindoffates">web site</a>) Looks like a very young/small guild (smaller than Avatars of the Ancients).  The fact that the leader is only a level 17 player makes me wonder if they'll stick with the game (but that's just an initial reaction).   There is nobody over level 30 in the guild (as far as I can tell).  They bill themselves as a 'mature role-playing' guild.  Now, I always have my character in '/role' mode (party to obscure the fact that I'm a magician who can do binds, mostly because I would prefer to role-play), but some role-play guilds are stricter than others.<br /><br /><i>Vorish of Morell-Thule, High Elf Mage lvl 18 (yes I dinged a few days ago, whee!!!)</i>
