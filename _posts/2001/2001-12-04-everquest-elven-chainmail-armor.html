<a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_high_elf.htm">EQTraders Secret High Elf Smithing</a><br /><br />Why? Because my caster (a high elf mage) could wear this armor and a full set of Elven Chainmail only weighs 16.3lbs while provding 79AC (4.847 AC per lb).  FYI, the ratio on banded armor (which my mage can't wear anyway) is only 2.578 (a full set of small banded weights 35.3lbs and provides 91AC).  For a mage with only 57 STR native, weight is pretty important (and my high elf cleric only has a STR of 60).  You figure on carrying a weapon that weighs 5-10 lbs, plus 5lbs of provisions/misc, and carrying 35lbs of armor means I'll be close to encumbered even without looting anything.  My cleric's armor weight is right around 25lbs right now (I'm making a set of reinforced leather 67AC for 19.5lbs to help that character).<br /><br />So what does it take to make (and how much will the useable components cost me? enchanted or imbued/enchanted will cost even more):<br /><br /><b>Making the Armour</b> - Smithing, Trivials 176-243+<br />Chainmail pattern - ?<br />Silk Swatch - 2pp<br />Moonlight Temper - ?<br />Mithril Rings (1-3 per piece) - <br /><br /><b>Moonlight Temper</b> - Brewed, Trivials at 135<br />Morning Dew (foraged) - 2pp?<br />Swirling Mist (dropped) - ?<br />2 Essence of Moonlight (dropped) - ?<br /><br /><b>Mithril Rings</b> - Smithing, Trivials <= 175<br />Morning Dew (foraged) - 2pp?<br />Large Brick of Mithril Ore - ?
