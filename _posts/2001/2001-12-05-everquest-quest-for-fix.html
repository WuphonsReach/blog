Sigh, they've royally screwed up this Shadows of Luclin roll-out (and I'm not even going to install the expansion pack).  They've 'fixed' things so that even classic EQ doesn't work on systems that it ran fine on until Monday's patch.<br /><br />Looks like I'll be off-line for a few days to a few weeks until:<br /><br />a) Verant gets its head out of its nether regions<br />b) I get a new laptop that will run EQ
