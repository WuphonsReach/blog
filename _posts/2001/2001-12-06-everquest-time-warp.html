(sung to the <i>Time Warp</i>)<br /><br />It's just a bump(wad) to the left,<br />and then a wav to the right...<br />you put your hands on your files,<br />and pull your specs in tight...<br />but it's the main patch server (up down up down)<br />that really drives me insa-a-a-ane...<br />let's crash to desktop again!<br /><br />(found it on one of the tech support message forums)
