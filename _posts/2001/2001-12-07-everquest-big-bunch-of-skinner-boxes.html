(Note: they wiped the boards again on Sunday, so I had to completely repost my issue - annoying...)<br /><br /><hr><br />I have a Creative Audio PCI 64 ES1370 sound card and am getting muffled-muddy sounds (like my footsteps, other mobs, spell casts, looting), but the thunder sounds just fine.<br /><br />I've done the DirectX 8.1 followed by reinstalling my sound drivers to no avail.
