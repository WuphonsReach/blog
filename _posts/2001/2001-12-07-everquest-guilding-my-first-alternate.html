My first alternate is a high-elf cleric named Corish and now that I've gotten him up to level 11 I decided it was time to get guilded so I could listen to the guild chat while playing my alternate.  That, and it was time to let Fel in on the secret identity of my alt.  You see, my original plan was to level my alt up and see if I could get invited into the <a href="http://eq-avatars.hypermart.net/">Avatars of the Ancients</a> guild again based on my alt's reputation.  Well, I did take it so far as to get Fel's attention on one or two instances, but events in Norrath have gotten very hectic lately and it was becoming too difficult to keep up the illusion.  Plus, there's a level 11 warrior that I think would make a good addition to the guild if I can catch up with her (saw her in Blackburrow while playing my main last night).<br /><br />I don't think Fel is <i>too</i> mad at me for keeping her in the dark, she only called me a crackhead once but did go ahead and guild my alternate.  (Well, actually she's now called me a crackhead twice... she says I have to make sure my readers get the REAL count.)
