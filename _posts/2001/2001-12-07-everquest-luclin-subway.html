Yes, I got EQ back up and running last night, but I'll be running out today to pickup another 256Mb of RAM (since I want to see all the shiny new player models).  So I'll be running 512Mb on a Pentium II 400Mhz with a GeForce2 MX 400 AGP 64Mb video card ('s very nice).<br /><br />The new textures for the old world zones is a very nice eye-candy and useable at 256Mb (but I only have 160Mb free).  However, I only have enough memory to load 4 player models (I've chosen wood elf male/female and high elf male/female).  <br /><br />The biggest reason to pickup Luclin if you only have 256Mb RAM?<br /><br />The 'Luclin Subway' (or at least that's what I'm calling it).  Basically it lets you teleport up from 4 different wizard spires on Norrath (Greater Faydark, North Karana, Toxx Forest, and a place in Kunark) up to the Nexus on Luclin for free (you have to hail the 'Nexus Scion' NPC to get a teleport shard) and you can teleport back to any of the four locations from the Nexus on Luclin.  Total trip time will range from 15-30 minutes and costs nothing.  I haven't worked out the schedule overlaps yet, but all teleports happen every 15 minutes and you get 5 minute, 3 minute, 2 minute, and 1 minute warnings before the teleports kick in.  So if your in Greater Faydark and need to run to the bank, you'll have ample notice in order to catch your teleport.<br /><br />So now I can get from Qeynos back to Kelethin reasonably easy (super easy would be running up to Surefall Glade and paying for a druid port).  I haven't figured out yet if this will lower druid teleport prices or not (since druid teleports are instantaneous and have more destinations).
