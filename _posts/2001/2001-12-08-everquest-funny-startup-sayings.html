You know that screen that appears where it loads all the textures?  Well, I'm trying to collect all of the funny phrases that the developers have dropped in there (so e-mail me if you see one that's not on the list).  Reminds me a lot of the odd sayings you'd find in SimCity:<br /><br />Attaching beards to dwarves...<br />Does anybody actually read this?<br />Dusting off spell books...<br />Have you hugged an Iskar today?<br />Looking for graphics &lt;LFG&gt;...<br />Now spawning Fippy_Darkpaw_432,326,312...<br />Teaching snakes to kick...<br />You have got better at Loading (6)!<br /><br /><i>Others that I have not personally seen yet (send tells if you've seen them):</i><br />Adding vanilla flavor to ice giants...<br />Aradune Is Still Stinky<br />Banging on the keyboard will not make this go any faster...<br />Creating randomly generated feature...<br />Darkening Dark Elves<br />Doing things you don't want to know about..<br />Ensuring Gnomes are Still Short...<br />Entering randomly mispeled words...<br />Feeding the bears...<br />Filling halflings with pie...<br />Have you tried batwing crunchie cereal?<br />Hiding cat-nip from the Vah Shir...<br />Loading, don't wait if you don't want to...<br />Look out behind you...<br />Looking up Barbarian Kilts...<br />Making Barbarians tall...<br />Making Gnomes short...<br />Making sure everything works Perfektly...<br />Polishing Erudite Foreheads...<br />Preparing to spin you around rapidly...<br />Random nerfing of SOW...<br />Reloading Death Touch Ammunition!<br />Sanding wood elves, now 45% smoother...<br />Stupidificationing Ogres...<br />Sharpening Claws...<br />Starching high elf robes...<br />Told You It Wasn't Made of Cheeze<br />Warning, Half Elves are now only .49999 elves...<br />Whacking trolls with ugly stick...<br /><br />Found in <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/012834.html">EQ Humor</a> and <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/013063.html">Humor before char select screen </a> threads on Sony's TNZ.
