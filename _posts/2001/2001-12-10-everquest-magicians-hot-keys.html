Guess now that I've had to set my hot-keys up from scratch again (after moving to the new system), I should probably jot them down... (along with my reasoning behind the keys).  Now, I don't know if it's because I have the Velious expansion that I get 10 hot keys per bank, or if Ruins of Kunark had them too, but since I play in full-screen HUD view I use all 10 keys.  Even when I'm in spellbook view, I can still use hot-keys 7,8,9,0 - I just have to hit the number key instead of using the mouse (actually, I prefer to use the keyboard for stuff like that).<br /><br /><b>Bank One</b> - Travel, Fishing, Misc<br />1) inventory slot (opens my food and gem bag)<br />2) inventory slot (opens my other small item bag)<br />3) n/a<br />4) n/a<br />5) n/a<br />6) Fishing<br />7) Bind Wounds (I should add a /say Bandaging %T, please don't heal!)<br />8) Location (does a /loc)<br />9) Sense Heading<br />0) Yell (does a /yell, /loc, /say Help! Please kill the %T that's attacking me!)<br /><br /><b>Bank Two</b> - Anti-Social Time (a.k.a. Soloing)<br />1) Pet Attack<br />2) Pet Back Off<br />3) Pet Guard Me<br />4) Pet Guard Here<br />5) Pet Report Health<br />6) n/a<br />7) Assist<br />8) Location (does a /loc)<br />9) Sense Heading<br />0) Yell (does a /yell, /loc, /say Help! Please kill the %T that's attacking me!)<br /><br /><b>Bank Three</b> - Group (non-verbal)<br />- most of these keys do not issue any verbals on the group chat channel, this bank is for an experienced group that doesn't need status information<br />1) Pet Attack<br />2) Pet Back Off<br />3) Pet Guard Me<br />4) Pet Guard Here<br />5) Pet Report Health<br />6) Damage Shield (does a /say Casting damage shield on %T!, then casts the gem)<br />7) Assist<br />8) n/a<br />9) n/a<br />0) Group Yell (does a /g Help! I'm being attacked by %T!, /loc)<br /><br /><b>Bank Four</b> - Group (verbal)<br />- these keys are more for when working with enchanters, or when working with a group that's not used to playing with a mage<br />1) Pet Attack (/pet attack, /loc, /g PET ATTACK [ %T ])<br />2) Pet Back Off<br />3) Pet Guard Me<br />4) Pet Guard Here<br />5) Pet Report Health<br />6) Damage Shield (does a /g DAMAGE SHIELD [ %T ], then casts the gem)<br />7) Assist<br />8) n/a<br />9) n/a<br />0) Group Yell (does a /g Help! I'm being attacked by %T!, /loc)<br /><br />I've been in pickup groups that have been pretty bad at announcing pulls.  I've seen two good pulling setups for puller hot keys.  The idea is that you announce the pull as it builds so the group knows what to expect when you arrive.  When you reach the attack spot, the main assist (or main tank) should then call out what the primary target is (and let the enchanter/bard crowd-control the rest).  Telling the group when to attack also helps casters who have noses buried in spell-books and need a verbal cue to know who to assist and who to send the pet after (I have to wait till I see the puller getting beat on in my chat window before assisting and sending in the pet, otherwise my pet is likely to attack a mob that might be rooted/charmed/mezzed or a mob that is far away from the action):<br /><br /><b>Pulling by the numbers</b><br />1) /g PULLING [ %T ]<br />2) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 1 FRIEND<br />3) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 2 FRIENDS<br />4) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 3 FRIENDS<br />5) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 4 FRIENDS<br />6) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 5 FRIENDS<br />7) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 6 FRIENDS<br />8) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 7 FRIENDS<br />9) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS 8 FRIENDS<br />0) /g PULLING [ %T ] PLUS A HUGE TRAIN<br /><br /><b>Pulling by levels</b><br />1) /g PULLING [ %T ] GREEN<br />2) /g PULLING [ %T ] LIGHT BLUE<br />3) /g PULLING [ %T ] BLUE<br />4) /g PULLING [ %T ] EVEN<br />5) /g PULLING [ %T ] YELLOW<br />6) /g PULLING [ %T ] RED<br />7) /g PULLING [ %T ] AND ONE FRIEND<br />8) /g PULLING [ %T ] AND TWO FRIENDS<br />9) /g PULLING [ %T ] WITH 3 OR MORE FRIENDS<br />0) /g UH OH! [ %T ] IS CRASHING THE PARTY!<br /><br />That last one is a good 'prepare to evac' call meaning we're not ready to escape yet, but it's looking like something nasty is coming.  I figure that call would usually be followed by a EVAC/ZONE/CAMP/GATE call by the main tank.  I've also seen some funny pulling sayings where the puller has a whole bank dedicated to funny incoming/pulling messages.  Most people recommend using the funny sayings at first, then switching to more generic sayings after the first few pulls.  I like funny pulling sayings, but I don't like funny sayings that don't include the name of the mob (the %T macro).  Some funny sayings from the message boards that I like (these are all groupsays of course):<br /><br />We've already ruined our own lands! Let's ruin a %T's!<br />Incoming! A %T is biting my tail! (good for Iskars or Val Shirs)<br />INC: A %T followed me home, can we keep it?<br />INC: Hey Rocky! Watch me pull a %T out of my hat!<br />Watch me trick %T out of %P Pebbles!<br />Let's give a big Norrath welcome to %T!<br />I caught this %T defiling Norrath. Let's kill it!<br />Time to die %T!<br />Incoming %T!! Get ready!
