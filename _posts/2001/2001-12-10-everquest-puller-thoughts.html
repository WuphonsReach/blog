[steps up on soap box and prepares to preach to the choir]<br /><br />Use a supply of summoned throwing daggers to pull with (easier than running up and trying to hit a moving mob).  It's possible that you don't even have to hit the mob with the thrown dagger to aggro it.  Plus, you get a little bit of a head-start on running back to your group (less chance of getting beat on even if you do have Spirit of the Wolf on you).<br /><br />Or let whichever caster has the longest range, low-mana spell pull (without them leaving the 'say' range of the group).  My cleric's lowest level nuke seems to have a <i>huge</i> range compared to most of my mage spells.<br /><br />When pulling, don't attempt to 'pull through' the group leading the mob anywhere near the casters that are meditating.  About half the time, those mobs will immediately aggro on the casters who will then have to spend precious seconds (and usually a bubble or two of health and lots of interrupted casts) unaggro'ing themselves.  This happens very often when a puller is getting beat on by adds who have not been harmed by anyone else (hence, their hate list is very easily re-arranged by seeing a meditating caster).  Keep the fight away from the casters (and make sure to announce that it's 'beating time' when you finally get the pull back to the group).<br /><br />Thou shalt only have one puller... 'nuff said.  If there are two who desire to be 'bait', let them alternate pulls so the one can heal while the other pulls.<br /><br />If you have a mage with an earth pet and get a multiple pull, let the mage 'pet park' one of the mobs away from the melee point.  Odds are the mage can keep the pet alive long enough and the pet will keep the mob parked long enough that you can clean up the first then let the mage pull the mob by backing the pet off and waiting for the root spell to dispell.  If your lucky, you'll either end up with a severely damaged or even dead mob by the time you need to take that mob on.
