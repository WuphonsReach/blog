From the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/013042.html">message board</a>: ... "Last night the group I was in lost track of whose turn it was to loot. I said,"when in doubt, let the cleric loot." I heard a round of "amen"s and the cleric happily looted =)" ...<br /><br /><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/013042.html">One of the commandments of EverQuest:</a> "Thou shalt not annoy the cleric, for they can suddenly lag and not notice you dying."<br /><br />All this in reference to a post where the warrior tank wouldn't let the cleric loot because 'he wasn't hacking and slashing like the warrior'.<br /><br />And a <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/clericguide.htm">cleric guide from EQ Cleirc</a>.
