Ugh, 6 hours of play and only 1 yellow to show for it (it takes 5 yellow bubbles to complete a level).  I can tell that level 30 is one of those "heck" levels (the experience required to complete this level is double that of level 29).  Well, that, and I died 3 times (so I should've gotten 2 yellows tonight, maybe more).  Just couldn't seem to do anything right tonight, we had 9 deaths in those 6 hours, I just couldn't keep the other players alive (lost 3 of them during the same fight).  So, I'm a little dissapointed in my cleric skills tonight (as I'm sure the other players were as well).<br /><br />Guess it was payback time since I managed not to die at all from levels 25 to 29 (and hadn't lost but one or two people this entire week while I was the group's cleric).  Some nights, you just can't get the group balanced enough to get ahead of the spawns in the Warrior Room, and take the spawns in the Raider Room.  (All of our nasty events were due to the Warrior Room re-popping while we were fighting the Raider Room mobs.)<br /><br />Oh well, learn from your mistakes and all that, gives me more time to maximize my melee and specialization skills.
