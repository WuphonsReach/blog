Last night, while working on my swimming skill in Felwithe's swimming pool (a.k.a. the lake on the backside of town), I got a tell from a level 14 cleric.  Now, usually at this point, I cringe, because I'm expecting to read that little purple text and see a request for money or items.  This time I was pleasantly surprised, because they wanted to know how many level 14 cleric spells there were, and how many of the 14 I used (a young cleric trying to prioritize his purchases).<br /><br />Well, the questions soon turned fairly far reaching, discussing healing aggro, armor class, whether clerics can solo, where to level up, do we get any DoTs, what is a symbol buff, etc.  The comment was made at one point, "wow, I didn't realize this class was so complex" (and I got to extoll the rush of handling a 4 giant pull from the Frontier Mountain fort with no deaths).<br /><br />It was a fun conversation, hopefully it helps add another well played cleric to our server.
