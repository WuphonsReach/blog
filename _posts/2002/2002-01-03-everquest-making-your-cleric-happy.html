...and a happy cleric is more likely to keep you alive (LOL).  Actually, only the very worst clerics will let you die out of revenge (it's just not good for a cleric's reputation ya know); but even the best clerics may become distant and withdrawn (and not as careful with your health) after a while if you don't show appreciation.<br /><br />- Be a Master Looter (or at least offering to sell items for the cleric as well when you run to sell)... frankly, I hate to leave the group's location to go sell, because if all craziness breaks loose while I'm gone (badly timed pop, or a wandering tombstone mob) I'll feel really bad about it.  On the other hand, if I don't go sell, I'll be enumbered, my agility drops to low levels and I get hit more often (and for more damage) when I gain aggro from healing someone.  Which means I may not loot after a while, leading to a poor cleric, which despite a cleric's best intentions results in a not-so-happy cleric.  Or I may decide that I need to go sell and decide not to come back.  (Actually offering to sell for any of your casters is a nice touch as well.  Especially if they're tired of running low on mana and need a good long mana break.)<br /><br />- Supply the gems needed to buff you!  Right now I have a symbol spell (<a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=714">Symbol of Transal</a>) which adds 30-75 hp (it was 30hp when I got the spell, now it adds 60 or 70 a few levels later) but uses a Cat's Eye Agate which costs around 5pp per stack.  This spell lasts about 30 minutes (actually a little longer, but with deaths and dispelling by mobs, 30 minutes is a good round number), and if I buff a full group it's 12 gems per hour (or about 3pp).  Over the course of a long camp (3-4 hrs, I can easily burn through 2-3 stacks of these gems).  So unless you're willing to spot me 3 plat per hour as a stipend, I'm losing a good bit of my portion of the loot.  And it gets worse at my next symbol level spell (<a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=730">Symbol of Ryltan</a>) which uses a 5gp bloodstone (10 plat per stack) so my costs will increase to 6 plat per hour at level 24.  At level 34 I get <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=751">Symbol of Pizarn</a> uses Jasper (8 gp each), but since the spell lasts longer, costs only go up to 8 plat per hour.  Then there's the level 44 spell, <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=770">Symbol of Naltron</a> which eats a Peridot (11 plat gem) and lasts for 9/10ths of an hour, resulting in a cost of 73 plat per hour (heck, let's say 75) if I want to keep the entire group buffed.  Of course, unless it's a raid, level 44+ clerics hardly ever use the Symbol of Naltron (500hp) on anyone other than the main tank (preferring to rely on the Symbol of Pizarn, a 300hp buff, for most group situations).<br /><br />So between the costs of spells, the costs of armor, and the costs of gems... it's a wonder that clerics are ever able to make a profit some days.  Well, at least I don't have to buy bladed weapons (since clerics can only use blunt).  The good news is that the better groups take care of their clerics (because a well played cleric means the difference between life and death for a group in a tight spot, just like most groups would die from a 4+ mob pull without an enchanter).
