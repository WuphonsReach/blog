Half the fun of EQ some days is reading and posting to the message boards (over my lunch hour, honest!).  (Having died close to 10 times in the past week, averaging about 1 death per level lately, this topic hits home.)<br /><br /><a href="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=1&t=000715">Why huge exp losses @ death?</a> - this has been a very enjoyable thread.  Some people just won't accept the fact that it takes hundreds of hours to play to level 60, instead whining that they can't seem to get ahead only playing 2 hours a week.  Basically, these people need to go play something a little more solo-oriented.  The other question I have, is if setbacks like lost experience bother you so much, why are you putting yourself on a time-table?  Enjoy the journey, not the destination.  I've always said, you may not be able to control your circumstances, but you are in full control of your reaction to those circumstances.
