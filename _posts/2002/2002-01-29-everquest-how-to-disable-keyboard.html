Just a quick note for those people who hit that nasty "windows" key while playing EverQuest (of course, crashing you out to the desktop at a most inconvenient time).  Microsoft has a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q216893">article</a> on how to disable this key.  All the usual caveats apply of course.<br /><br />Now, if I could just convince EQ not to let me Alt-Tab out on Windows 2000....
