Hooray, finally made it to level 31 (I'm out of the double-experience level.)  Hopefully, I'm now quit of High Keep for good (was growing mushrooms on top of my head from being down in the basement for so long).  On the plus side, I've finally caught up to a large group of my guildmates so I can start adventuring with them.<br /><br />Even better is that I have a bunch of new friends from Clan Silvermoon (waves at Ravina, Nomynnya, Shalissa), and a bunch of others on my friends list that I'd love to have in our guild.
