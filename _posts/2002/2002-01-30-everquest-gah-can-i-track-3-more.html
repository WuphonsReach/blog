Heh, the title pretty much says it all.  Basically, when I logged in last night I had to pay attention to the group's battle, down-time chat in the group, while simultaneously handling 3 other conversations in direct tells.  Oh, and don't forget keeping an eye on the guildchat and attempting to also read the /ooc and /shout channel.  In fact, once I did /random 100 when the other group near us was rolling because I thought I had missed the call to roll on some item drop (sighs, <i>Solarflare</i> didn't make too much fun of me for that).  Then there was the random tells asking me to join a group, or "can you experience rez?" tells (I was the only cleric in Frontier Mountains last night).<br /><br />So if you ever wonder why I'm taking a bit of time to get back to a tell, or asking "um, what were we talking about?", it's probably because I'm trying to juggle too many indepth conversations.
