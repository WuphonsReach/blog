Sigh, well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.  AotA is disintegrating, and I'm afraid that I have to add into the chaos by choosing this time to move on as well.  Simply put, our first officer left the guild at the start of the week, taking 4 or 6 other members with her.  Which has forced me to examine my ties to the guild as well, since many of the people that left this week were those that I had originally joined the guild to be a part of.  So after many days of considering the future, I decided that my heart really wasn't in staying with AotA with those people no longer a part of the guild.  (And it was also making EQ not as fun to play.)<br /><br />So I'm off to seek fame and fortune for a while as a guildless cleric (with a very full friend's list).
