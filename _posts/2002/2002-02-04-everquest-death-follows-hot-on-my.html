(story starts in the present, flashback to the past, then continues on to the end)<br /><br />Panting heavily, I begin my climb up the side of the mountain, trying to reach the safety of the lands beyond the mountain pass. <br /><br />(trees are thick here, hopefully offering me some cover, so many enemies dodged on my run across the valley, but I'm moving slower now that I'm near death, have I lost them? I can no longer hear the dying cries of my party.  with my cleric's intuition, I have felt my party's threads of life slip from my grasp as each has fallen victim to the giants)<br /><br />(flashback)<br /><br />(we had been sneaking in and out of the giant fort all morning, pulling those dreadfully stupid young scragglies out for the slaughter)<br /><br />(but the giants had gotten wise to our tactics and enlisted two elders to sit in waiting for our next foray into their fort)<br /><br />(our next pull brought 2 of the young ones in addition to the two elders and the fight quickly became chaotic as the giants turned the tables, dividing the party)<br /><br />(all fought bravely, but the odds were against us, the call to run by the melees)<br /><br />(running, encumbered, not moving as fast as I should've since my magical speed had worn off, dropping the heavy bag of copper, dropping the huge sword that I had looted)<br /><br />(flash forward to present)<br /><br />(the end draws near, last minute decisions need to be made, cast my 2nd invuln? cast a heal on myself? or run?)<br /><br />(stopping to catch my breath and heal my wounds, the giants catch up, death under the branches)
