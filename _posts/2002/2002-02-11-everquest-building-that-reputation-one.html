Corish (my cleric) finally made it out of level 35 purgatory (level 35 takes 2-3 times the normal amount of experience points to get through compared to the previous level) into fast moving level 36 (the exp bar seems to fly after suffering through level 35).  On the downside, there is a "double-dutch" experience penalty in level 36.  I'm not sure if you lose twice as much experience as normal (say, compared to how much you lose in level 37), but when you die in level 36 you lose a yellow and a half of experience (in level 35 I only lost 2-3 blues on a death).  So it seems 2-4 times worse when you die in level 36.<br /><br />Anyway... after a boring evening of grouping in The Overthere zone, I was a in a group with 3 other guildmates (ranger, druid, cleric) along with a so-so rogue and a so-so shaman.  Basically, the pulls weren't going well (our ranger was having difficulty keeping pulls coming, maintaining aggro, and keeping her mana levels up with no time to meditate, the rogue gained aggro too much resulting in heals needed, and I'm not sure what the shaman was up to).  Took us a few pulls to get a system of rooting into place (I did stun-root duty, while the other cleric did heals), having the ranger step on the mobs toes while the rogue backstabbed.  Again, not important to the story, except that it made us decide to join a guildmate who was organizing a dungeon crawl in the next zone.  <br /><br />So the 4 of us guildmates set off running across the middle of The Overthere, which, as long as Spirit of Wolf is up and you avoid wandering mobs is pretty safe.  Except that I was encumbered and had forgotten to get a STR buff refreshed so I wouldn't be slower than the others, so I'm constantly running behind.  We had to stop and fight a single blue mob that aggro'd on us (no big deal, just danger of adds from other wandering mobs), mob killed we start running again.  Unfortunately, just as we get started running again, I see the following on my chat window:<br /><br />Dragoon TVem says 'Come and feel the blade of the Dark Bargainers.'<br />Dragoon TVem says 'It's High Elves like you who have ruined your own lands. You'll not ruin mine.'<br /><br />(winces, since I'm the only high elf in the immediate vicinity this level 50 mob is obviously going to hurt, um, me.  The time is now 22:02:06, time for our group's appointment with a painful death sequence.)<br /><br />22:02:06 Dragoon TVem says 'Come and feel the blade of the Dark Bargainers.

The other 3 members lived (cheers).  Was a bit of fun after a boring evening.  No, I didn't really WANT to be the hero, but since I was the slowest it was simpler to attempt to keep the goon busy for as long as possible (and as far away from my group as possible).  If I could've gotten the DA off, I might have made it closer to the Skyfire zone (or at least lasted another 18 seconds).  Moot point since the other 3 managed to get away safely anyway.
