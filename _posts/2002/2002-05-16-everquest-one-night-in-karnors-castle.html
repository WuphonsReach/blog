8:30pm - login, get into a group, work our way back to "hand" room and begin killing<br /><br />9:20pm - <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4588">Venril Sathir</a> kills our puller, apparently VS is out wandering the castle instead of staying in his room<br /><br />10:00pm - puller has been pulling continously despite my being at 20 mana or less after rezzing the puller, bad pull, MA gets killed, hand room pops, hallway adds into the fray, everyone gates or runs to zone line where they find out that VS is camping the zone line<br /><br />10:20pm - making our way back to the "hand" room<br /><br />10:30pm - VS pops on top of us again on the way to hand room, I use up Divine Aura, jump in the moat and swim to the zone line<br /><br />11:00pm - we zone back in, making our way back to the "hand" room again<br /><br />11:35pm - hand room pops, multiple adds from the hallway, group has to run to the zone line again<br /><br />11:45pm - group calls it a night<br /><br />And somehow, during all of that I made 2 or 3 blues of experience and only lost 2 people all night.
