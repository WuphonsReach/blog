(from a post on EQCleric that I made)<br /><br />Hmm, I'm also pretty much the only active cleric most evenings in my guild as well (54 cleric).  Although there are a few other non-regulars, or alts of people that play some evenings that are clerics.  I used to run all over the place and rez anyone... which didn't get me anywhere, and I got bugged out the wazoo for rezzes.  Now, I'm a bit more enlightened.<br /><br />1) If I'm just puttering around town, or doing trade skills AND you've died in an easily accessible place; I'll load up the druid bot and come rez you pretty quickly.  (How fast I come to your aid depends on how much of a team-player you are within the guild too.  Is just a personal quirk of mine.)<br /><br />2) If I'm grouped, the answer is no -- unless you've only got 30 minutes left on the corpse timer and you've been trying for 2 hours to bribe a cleric there.  (I never want to see a guildiee go without a rez, but I want to encourage them to not depend on guild clerics for rezzes.)<br /><br />3) If I'm soloing, the answer is no -- unless you can't find an in-zone rez within an hour.  At which point I will gladly come rez you.<br /><br />4) If it's a challenge of a corpse recovery (entire party died in LGuk dead-side for instance - that's a fun CR for a cleric) where I can manage the CR better then a party of nekkid guildmates.  Mistmoore castle was also a fun place to drag bodies out of (DA/DB and gate are the key skills once that invis drops).  Sometimes it's fun to play hero (although I may drag along my druid bot, or a fellow guildiee to help).  The key to #4 is that I get to have FUN while doing the CR (which is why I play EQ).<br /><br />I think that's a pretty much middle-of-the-road way of doing things... I don't get abused, nor do I ignore the needs of guildmates.
