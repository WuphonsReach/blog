(from another post on EQCleric that I made in regards to someone looking to parse their log files to calculate damage-per-second numbers)<br /><br />I don't parse our damage output (yet)... but we make use of the modal damage calculations to figure out weapon choices: <br /><br />Modal Damage Primary Hand: (2*DMG + Damage Bonus)/Delay <br /><br />Modal Damage Secondary Hand: [(2*DMG)/Delay]* [(Level + Dual Wield Skill)/400] <br /><br />{Note that [(Level + Dual Wield Skill)/400] is believed to be the success for Dual Wield skill checks.}<br /><br />Note, that while you can't compare damage done by different classes (since special attacks are not taken into account, or skill levels, or double-attack, or bash damage)... it is a good way to quick calculate if some of your guild members should possibly look at upgrading their weapons. Modal damage numbers are mainly to be used to calculate best weapon combinations for dual-wielding classes. <br /><br />Some sample numbers: <br /><br />Level 52 Shadowknight modals: <br /><br />2.172 Darkmetal Falchion 1HS 27/29 - PoH (rare no-drop off a knight of inny, Pal/SK) <br />1.621 Jeldorin 1HS 19/29 - Chardok (rare drop in graveyard camp off named, Pal only) <br />1.955 Skull Maul 1HB 17/22 - Cazic-Thule (rare drop, Pal/SK) <br />1.955 Goo Covered Knight Blade 17/22 1HS - Cazic-Thule (uncommon, Pal/Sk) - 15k <br />1.880 Sword of Blessings 19/25 1HS - Velk's Village (rare, Pal only) <br />1.781 Rod of Faith 24/32 1HB - Howling Stones (east wing, Pal only) <br />1.864 Engraved Di'zok Deathbringer 16/22 1HB - Chardok (graveyard camp, Pal/Sk/Cler, no-drop) <br />1.400 Wurmslayer 25/40 1HS - FV quest Rng/Pal/Sk/War <br />1.519 Sword of the Morning 16/27 1HS - 7.5k <br />2.000 Carved Dragonbone Shard 25/30 2HP - 8k <br />2.171 Etched Velium War Lance 30/35 2HP - 2k-3k <br />2.278 Tae Ew War Maul 33/36 2HB - 3k-5k <br />2.083 Tantor's Tusk 50/60 2HP - 8k <br />2.278 Savage Stone Axe 33/36 2HS - 4k-5k <br /><br />We're trying to get all of our melee that are 50+ to be using weapons that have modals of 2.0+ (figuring that it's at least better then them using weapons with modals of 1.5). Like I said, it's not a end-all-be-all number, but just a quick rule-of-thumb.
