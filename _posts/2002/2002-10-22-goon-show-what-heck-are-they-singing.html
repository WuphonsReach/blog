So anyway, I'm listening to "The Moriarty Murder Mystery" episode (8th series, 17th episode, Jan 20 1958), when Moriarty and Grytpype-Thynne break into a silly singing song around 5 minutes into the sketch (aparently for money since you hear a copper get dropped into their tin mug by a passer-by).  Finally, after listening to the song bit a few times (they only sing a few lines before the copper drops and they squable over who gets to hold it) I did a bit of searching on the web and here's what you hear them sing:<br /><br />Who's kissable, who's lovable?<br />Miss Annabelle Lee<br />Who's wonderful, who's marvelous?<br />Miss Annabelle Lee (my Annabelle Lee)<br />(copper drops into cup)<br /><br />This is actually a mangled version of "Miss Annabelle Lee (Who's Wonderful? Who's Marvelous?)" which was written back in circa 1942-1946 by Richman, Sidney Clare, Lew Pollack on the album "Unheard, Vols. 1 & 2: 1942-1946" (<a href="http://www.spiritofsinatra.com/pages/Lyrics/m/Miss_Annabelle_Lee.htm">lyrics</a>, <a href="http://www.thepeaches.com/music/frank/MissAnnabelleLeeWhosWonderfulWhosMarvelous.txt">2nd version</a>) in that they sing lines 3 and 4 before singing lines 1 and 2.<br /><br />Well, it's all in the mind you know...
