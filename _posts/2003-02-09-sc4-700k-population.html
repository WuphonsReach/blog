<a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/">My region</a> now has 700k+ population.  I've only gotten (3) of the cities above 100k so far, most of the others are stuck at mid-30k  (or lower).
<br />
<br />On a side note, I installed the Feb 3rd patch, and I'm really not seeing any more skyscrapers then I had before in <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/oysterbay.shtml">Oyster Bay</a>.  Maybe my region isn't big enough yet, or 100k population is still too small.
