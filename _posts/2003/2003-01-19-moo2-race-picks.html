Okay, last MOO2 thing for now.  Here is my current favorite racial picks.  This race is designed to compete aggressively with even the Sakkra (who have 100% population growth).  I may fall behind on the population growth side, but the 50% boost to industrial output from Unification makes it possible to build up worlds and colonies faster then they can.  I also set aside small worlds that have Automated Factories and Robo Miners as housing colonies (strip the colony down to 1 population, set the build queue to Housing).  These housing colonies can produce 1 unit of population every 2-2.5 turns which I then ship off to my frontier colonies.<br /><br />Population: +50% (+3)<br />Farm: -0.5 (-3)<br />Industry: 0 (0)<br />Science: 0 (0)<br />Money: 0 (0)<br />Ship Defense: -20 (-2)<br />Ship Attack: 0 (0)<br />Ground Combat: -10 (-2)<br />Spying: -10 (-3)<br />Government: Unification (+6)<br />Specials: Aquatic (+5), Subterranean (+6)
