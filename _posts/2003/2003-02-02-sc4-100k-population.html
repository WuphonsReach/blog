Got my first city to 100k population this weekend (<a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/southbend.shtml">South Bend</a>).  I'm also in the process of fixing some of the writing style, adding in more details, and trying to stay on top of all of the cities that I've created within the region.
<br />
<br />Total region population is now 339k.
