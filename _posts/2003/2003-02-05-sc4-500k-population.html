Uggh, finally grew the <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/">region</a> past 500,000 population.  From what I'm seeing, there's a definite population cap at 20k for a city - unless you add health and education items.  (I've got more then a few cities that are capped at 20k.)  I'm even beginning to suspect that there's a 5k cap if you don't have water pipes (maybe 10k?).  I notice that residences will only develop to the single-double family homes when relying on well water.
<br />
<br />At 120k, my South Bend city was awarded a movie studio... (the mayor refused to comment on whether he was going to be starring in any upcoming movies).
