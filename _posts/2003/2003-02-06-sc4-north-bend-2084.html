Whoops... had a bit of a disaster in my city of <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/northbend.shtml">North Bend</a> last night.  I was using the bulldozer tool, when a fire broke out elsewhere in the city.  Somehow I managed to bulldoze a very large swath, including the area downtown that I had just rezoned about 30 minutes before. (My own mini-disaster!)  Since it was so late, I just saved and went to bed.
<br />
<br />So, now I get the joy of putting the simulation on pause, repairing as much damage as possible (water, power connections are critical) before I run out of cash and/or population.  Eh, so now I have a large area that I can rebuild from scratch instead of having to work around existing buildings and infrastructure.
