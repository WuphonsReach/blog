Well, not too difficult a task.  It only took 2 hours to go from 55k pop down to 45k pop and then climbed up to 85k pop (which is more then I had at it's previous peak).  The "West Point" area that fits into the river bend seems to be undergoing a slight recession, but the rebuild "East Shore" area across the river has rebounded quickly enough to balance it out.  With a few more hours of work, I think North Bend is going to start vying with South Bend for the population lead.<br /><br />One of the things that I'm beginning to suspect is that water volume does not mean that you'll get good water coverage if you have aging and decrepit water pumps.  I had 50% more water then I needed, yet instead of water being available up to 5-6 tiles away from a pipe, I was only seeing a coverage span of 2-3 tiles away from a pipe.  After I went around and checked all of my water pumps for efficiency (destroying any that were below 75%), I again had the coverage that I had originally designed for.
