Woot! I finally passed the 100k mark in <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/northbend.shtml">North Bend</a> which is my 2nd city to pass 100k in this region.
<br />
<br />One of the bugs that has surfaced as a result of that massive demolition accident is that my fire engines can get stuck "out of station", which means that they're not available to dispatch.  (They seem to get lost due to the massive number of dead-end roads in the industrial area.)  The only fix was to go around and delete/rebuild all of the fire stations (same with the police stations).
