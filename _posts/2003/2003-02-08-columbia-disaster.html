<a href="http://www.space.com/columbiatragedy/">space.com</a> has a very good in-depth coverage of this event (including a very informative FAQ that is constantly being updated).  The FAQ is impressive too, more so that it's being kept up to date as new events come to light.  This is the way that news should be covered, IMHO, it sure beats trying to stay on top of a zillion different versions of static published FAQs as typically get put out by traditional news sources.  Plus, all sorts of links, background information, and unlike Yahoo! Full Coverage - they have the actual images in question (no more reading in Yahoo! that such-and-such image showed something - then having to go track down a copy of the image).
<br />
<br />All in all, looks like they're doing an excellent job of covering this.
