Broke the 800k population mark last night in my <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/">Wuphons Reach</a> region.  <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/montessa.shtml">Montessa</a> was the heavy hitter last night, growing to 70k population.  Demand is still through the roof, so I suspect I'll be able to grow it to 100k easily (lots of space left on the 4x4 km tile).  <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/kebsun.shtml">Kebsun</a>, a new city that I started this weekend grew obnoxiously fast - it's a trashily (hastily) designed city that already has 50k population (not bad for a 2x2km tile).
