Just jotting some notes and prices down, to see if I can figure out how neighbor deals are calculated.  Numbers in parents are cost per unit purchased or sold.
<br />
<br />Kirkenes has the following income deals:
<br />
<br />Bayview - Water - 1000/mo @ $30 ($0.030)
<br />Westview - Water - 165976/mo @ $5113 ($0.031)
<br />Jenza - Water - 35737/mo @ $1107 ($0.031)
<br />
<br />and the following expense deals:
<br />
<br />Jenza - Power - 33255/mo @ $3754 ($0.113)
<br />Jenza - Garbage - 774/mo @ $2114 ($2.731)
<br />
<br />Now, production of water costs me - $0.021 from a water tower or $0.0175 from a water pump - so to sell water is very profitable.
