Taking a closer look at the cost of doing business with the neighboring cities (just like I did with <a href="/blog/2003_02_09_blogarchive.shtml#88954489">looking at Kirkenes' neighbor deals</a>).  This time, I'm gonna do a quick survey of some sell-side deals (which bring in income to a city).<br /><br /><b><a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/northbend.shtml">North Bend</a></b><br />Power/South Bend - 6012 @ $611 ($0.102)<br />Water/South Bend - 20664 @ $762 ($0.037)<br />Water/Eaton Gorge - 20555 @ $721 ($0.035)<br /><br /><b><a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/montessa.shtml">Montessa</a></b><br />Power/Greenleaf - 1000 @ $142 ($0.142)<br />Power/Faven - 1000 @ $140 ($0.140)<br /><br /><b><a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/blye.shtml">Blye</a></b><br />Power/Scelle - 3000 @ $335 ($0.112)<br />Power/Patrilii - 6000 @ $671 ($0.112)<br />Power/Oyster Bay - 21888 @ $2491 ($0.114)<br />Garbage/Weestview - 452 @ $1159 ($2.564)<br />Garbage/Scelle - 379 @ $1092 ($2.881)<br />Garbage/Patrilii - 268 @ $781 ($2.914)<br />Garbage/Oyster Bay - 799 @ $2323 ($2.907)<br /><br /><b><a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/scelle.shtml">Scelle</a></b><br />Water/Oyster Bay - 63750 @ $1764 ($0.028)<br />Water/Patrilii - 120492 @ $2957 ($0.024)<br />Water/Blye - 49080 @ $1184 ($0.024)<br /><br />Hmmm, I confess I don't see the pattern yet as to why some deals are worth more per unit then others... (too small of a sample set so far, and I don't know what the key elements in the equation are yet).
