Love the <a href="http://www.newshounds.com/d/19991013.html">shirt the guy's wearing</a> - "<a href="http://www.newshounds.com/d/19991013.html">I'm a Linux love god</a>" - and this from way back in 1999.  (Which isn't actually a real big deal, but I'd say that 1998/1999 is about the first time I encountered Linux and even had a system up and runing using it.)
