Screenies from my level 23 mage.  Cleaning out orc nests like these are great for experience!<br /><br />This is a shot after cleaning out the majority of the nest.  The entire area to the right of the purple mage figure was filled with all variants of orcs. (19x5 squares or 95 orcs)  Fortunately the door was on the far end, so I was able to sneak down the sides, draw half a dozen out then run back west and slaughter them in the long corridor.<br /><a href="/blog/blogpics/Angband/wuphon-23-cleaningoutanest.gif"><img src="/blog/blogpics/Angband/thumb400/wuphon-23-cleaningoutanest.gif" width="406" height="269" border="0" alt="Angband v3.03 - finishing up cleaning out a nest of orcs"></a><br /><br />Anytime you clear out a nest, you've got to have places to put all of the junk that drops.  In this case, I put all of the junk drops on the west wall, so-so drops along the north wall, and good drops on the east wall.  (Sometimes I put items down prior to tackling the nest.)<br /><a href="/blog/blogpics/Angband/wuphon-23-lootpiles.gif"><img src="/blog/blogpics/Angband/thumb400/wuphon-23-lootpiles.gif" width="406" height="269" border="0" alt="Angband v3.03 - piles of loot from cleaning out the orc nest."></a><br /><br />This is the list of equipment that he's wearing.<br /><a href="/blog/blogpics/Angband/wuphon-23-equiplist.gif"><img src="/blog/blogpics/Angband/thumb400/wuphon-23-equiplist.gif" width="406" height="269" border="0" alt="Angband v3.03 - equipment at level 23."></a>
