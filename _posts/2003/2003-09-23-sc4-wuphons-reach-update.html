The <a href="/Games/SimCity4/WR1/">Wuphons Reach Region</a> is now at 1.7 million population (largest city is 375k or so).  I also made a few changes to the Wataru region that I'm working on... but don't expect to see that custom region for another week or three.  Which leads me to my third item... MOO3 comes out this week, and if it's half a good / engrossing as I expect it will be, then SC4 updates are going to fall by the wayside for a week or three.
