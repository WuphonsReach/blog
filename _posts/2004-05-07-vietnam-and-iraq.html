As we enter the 2nd year of occupation of Iraq, I start to wonder whether we're going doing the Vietnam road again, or if we're going to start forging a whole new dirty road of "necessity".  Unfortunately, I'm a bit clueless as to what Vietnam was all about (a few years before my time).  One of the few books that I've read about it is <i>Conversations with the Enemy</i> by Winston Groom and Duncan Spencer (pub 1983).  Picked that up at a used book store in Huntingdon PA back in 1990/1991.  However, since I've never cross-checked the information with other sources, I've never taken it as "holy writ" about what happened.  Same with films like <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> and <i>Platoon</i>, not sure how close to reality those were.<br /><br />So I did a bit of shopping on the used book circuit, picking out half a dozen titles that seemed to be well received by various reviews and user comments on Amazon.  (This list is also known as my "summer reading list".)  We'll see how well I did if I come back blogging about them in the future.<br /><br />Here's what I ordered:<br /><br />The Vietnam War Almanac, Harry G. Summers<br />A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and the Final Tragedy of America's Last Years in Vietnam, Lewis Sorley<br />Fire in the Lake: The Vietnamese and the Americans in Vietnam, Frances Fitzgerald<br />A Bright Shining Lie : John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam, Neil Sheehan<br />Rumor of War, Philip Caputo<br />Vietnam: A History, Stanley Karnow<br />Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers, Daniel Ellsberg<br /><br />Since I already have <i>Secrets</i> and <i>A Rumor of War</i> (which arrived today), I'm planning on starting with those two.  (Probably <i>Secrets</i> as I've already read a few pages... in fact, there's a blurb by Senator John Kerry on the back cover.  Which is topical, as the Vietnam era seems to be something that both presidential candidates are attempting to bring up about the other.)<br /><br />Update:  <i>Secrets</i> is not a good starting book if you know nothing about the events surrounding 1964 (Gulf of Tonkin).  It's written from an insider perspective (the author was inside the Pentagon, seeing the dispatches from the ships in the Gulf as well as knowing about the war plans that were secretly being couriered around Washington D.C.).  That makes it a difficult read, because by page 16, he's throwing a <i>lot</i> of information at the reader.<br /><br />So, I'm going to switch over to looking at <i>A Rumor of War</i> instead (or wait for one of the other books to arrive).
