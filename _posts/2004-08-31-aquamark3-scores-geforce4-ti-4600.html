<a href="http://arc.aquamark3.com/">AquaMark3</a><br /><br />The following are with an AMD AthlonXP 2600+, DDR PC2700 (2x512MB), and a NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti4600 128MB AGP.<br /><br />NVIDIA 43.45 (stock, best quality, 128MB aperture, A7N8X-Deluxe)<br />AquaMark Score: 22253 (CPU: 6270, GFX: 2706)<br /><br />NVIDIA 56.72 (stock, best quality, 128MB aperture, A7N8X-Deluxe)<br />AquaMark Score: 19090 (CPU: 6253, GFX: 2253)<br /><br />NVIDIA 61.77 (stock, high performance, 128MB aperture, A7N8X-Deluxe)<br />AquaMark Score: 19480 (CPU: 6286, GFX: 2304)<br /><br />I bought a GigaByte FX 5900 XT this week, so I'll be posting new scores at some point.  Hopefully, I'll see scores in the 40k range, which will be roughly twice as fast as what I have now.  I looked around for a regular FX 5900 card, but couldn't find one in stock.  The price in the FX 5900 XT's is only $180-$200, which was right in my target range.
