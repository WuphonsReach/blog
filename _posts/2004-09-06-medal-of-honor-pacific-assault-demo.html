The demo for MoH:PA is out... it's "okay", but not spectacular and I think it needs a good bit of work before release.  (It's a 500+MB download, try GamersHell for a copy.)<br /><br />The environment was pretty, and it was neat that you could shoot things and see them move (tires, the wooden awnings, boxes) or shoot things and destroy them (supplies in the medical tent, the wooden awnings). The demo level wasn't that large, so I'm not sure whether MoH:PA levels can be as big as what I'm used to in CoD or not.<br /><br />The medic was cool, along with the death animation when you get killed (fade to gray). Combat was chaotic, but your teammates were pretty accurate with their shots and they'd constantly regroup, fall back, lay down suppressing fire.<br /><br />OTOH, the character models and animations left a lot to be desired (or finessed).<br /><br />Shoot an enemy, and they really don't react much other then stooping down to one knee and then standing back up. I wanted to see their body rock back when they got hit, or spin a bit when you wing one. Not much visual confirmation of landing a round unless you happen to see the teeny tiny blood spray.<br /><br />Model movements were jerky and very cartoonish. Hopefully they spend a few weeks polishing all of that up before release. Worst was the animation if you managed to bash someone to death. They flew 20+ feet and then skidded across the ground like a rag doll.<br /><br />If this was the "polished" version of the demo... I wonder what the unpolished version looked like?
