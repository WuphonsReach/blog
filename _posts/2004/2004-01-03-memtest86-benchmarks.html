Just some benchmark values from the machines I've been running MemTest86 on.<br /><br />First box is a Pentium III 550Mhz with (I believe) PC100 memory (MemTest86 reports it as a 568Mhz CPU).  L1 cache (32Kb) speed is 5567 MB/s, L2 cache (128K) speed is 2523 Mb/s, and main memory clocks in at 198 MB/s.  <br /><br />Second box is my Athlon XP 2600+ with <a href="http://www.memory4less.com/m4l_itemdetail.asp?itemid=2506452">GeIL DDR-333 (PC2700) ram</a> in a 2x512Mb configuration.  CPU speed is reported as 2088Mhz, L1 cache (128Kb) speed is 12808 Mb/s and main memory speed is 1182 MB/s.  This is the box with what I believe was the bad memory stick, so I've got both sticks in and I'm going to run tests overnight.  (Found errors after 1 hour, pulled the "good" module and left the suspected "bad" module in.  Memory speed is now reported as 734 MB/s since the DDR isn't active.  A single test-pass of 512Mb, using the default set of tests, takes around 30-35 minutes on this machine.)<br /><br />BTW, MemTest86 is a sweet little program.  If your machine can boot from CD-ROM (most can if they were made in the last few years), there's an ISO that you can download and create a bootable CD.  Pop the CD in, power-up and MemTest86 will automatically start running the default tests.  I ended up using an 8cm mini-CD since the ISO is only 16Mb or so.  Only disadvantage of the tiny size is that I can't use it in a side-ways mounted CD-ROM drive (no clips to hold it in place, tray has to be horizontal).  Also, once MemTest86 starts, you can remove the CD-ROM and go boot it in another PC.
