Bleh!<br /><br />How's that for a review?<br /><br />It's the 2nd expansion pack for the original Medal of Honor: Allied Assault series.  The original MoHAA was quite good and the Spearhead expansion was not too bad (although a bit short).<br /><br />Breakthrough... well... I have yet to find a level that's enjoyable to play.  Everything is extremely linear, usually with enemies hiding underneath every rock, and they all know where you are.  Zero room for error, you have to have advance knowledge of where the next bad guy is going to pop up from, and there are a few levels where ammo is problematic unless you're Annie Oakley.  Not to mention that whenever you're supposed to keep an allied bot alive, they'll do their darnedest to walk into the line of fire, or stand there while a grenade rolls around their feet.<br /><br />I've even tried playing it through on god-mode and it's still not enjoyable.  Probably the closest one to "fun" is sneaking around the aircraft base, disabling planes.  Although a handful of grenades would've made things much more enjoyable and the cut-scene after the mission is hillariously horrid as you watch planes take off from a standstill to wheels off the ground in under 30 feet.<br /><br />Save your cash, buy Call of Duty instead.
