Well, that didn't take long, because I ran into my first annoying player last night.  <br /><br />We were playing "Behind Enemy Lines", which is an unique form of multi-player where a few people are the prey and everyone else is hunting them.  The prey attempt to stay alive and hidden for as long as possible (gaining points every few seconds) while attempting to kill off any hunters (also gaining additional points).  The hunters attempt to find the prey and are guided by "?" marks on the compass (the "?" marks show where the prey was a few seconds ago and aren't very accurate).  If a hunter kills one of the prey players, the two players witch places as the hunting player now re-spawns as prey.<br /><br />This was towards the end of the night ('round midnight I think), so we were down to only having 1-2 prey and 3-4 hunting players.  I had just gotten tagged by a hunter and was re-spawning as a new hunter, so when I suddenly noticed someone standing near me with a weapon aimed in my direction I whirled and let off a shot.  Oops, that was a fellow hunter (our idiot, with an idiotic name).<br /><br />No harm done, however, since friendly-fire was turned off on this server.  So I just went on my way and started hunting the prey player.  Apparently, however, this immature brat's feelings were hurt because he proceeds to shadow my every step for the next 10 minutes, attempting to TK me.  Firing his weapon at me, attempting to melee me with it, or simply standing in my line of fire.  All of which is rather pointless since friendly-fire is turned off and it's accomplishing exactly zero.  So I just ignored him and worked my way around the edges of the open ground looking for movement in the far treeline where the prey was.<br /><br />Eventually, I spotted they prey making a break between cover.  Since he hadn't seen me on the far side (even with the idiot jumping up and down making a major racket), it was easy enough to side-step the idiot, draw a bead on my target and put it down.  (Thus, escaping my shadow by re-spawning as prey in another location.)<br /><br />Funny thing is that I have it all on tape, including what the idiot's name was prior to them changing it.  I'll have to looksee whether the kid was a clan member somewhere.
