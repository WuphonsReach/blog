Played a few hours of Call of Duty Multi-Player last night.  Mostly "Behind Enemy Lines" with a little "Headquarters" towards the end.  Mostly scored middle-of-the-pack, fragging as much as I got fragged.  I like "BEL" play, it's sorta like "directed death match" as 75% of the players attempt to hunt you down.  "HQ" is fine because of the ebb-n-flow where the two teams switch between offense/defense depending on who has control of the radio's current spawn point.  "BEL" is a good newbie game because you don't worry too much about teamwork (players switch sides too often).<br /><br />The big problem that I currently have is simply that I don't know the layout of the maps.  Where to setup ambushes, where not to stand to avoid sniper fire, the likely places where players will hide, what spots are easily defended.  Or simply, whether the map is conducive to using rifles over SMGs.<br /><br />One thing I wish they'd change is to make the Russian PPSH (SMG that holds 70+ rounds) a heavier weapon (like the Bren or BAR).  That would reduce the mobility and balance out that weapon a bit.  Once you use it, you see how over-powered it is between the rapid rate of fire and the huge capacity magazine.
