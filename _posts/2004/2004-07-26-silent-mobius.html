So far I've seen the first 14 episodes (out of 26) of Silent Mobius. The first episode is good, the second one is so-so and then it's a rough run up until episodes 12 & 13. Some of the early episodes are the formulaic "character introduction" episodes where we're given the characters background, usually while they're fighting a monster by themselves. We also have the required episode where the newly discovered heroine who's unsure whether she wants to be part of the team or not.<br /> <br />However, things do finally pickup the pace in episode 12 (Sister) when we start to learn about the background of the Lucifer Hawks and that certain characters are not what they seem. Episode 13 (Category IV) was good as well as things begin to fall apart and the battles between the two sides become more intense.<br /> <br /> So if you're like me, stuck in the doldrums about eps 3-11, go ahead and stick it out because it does start to get better in 12 &amp; 13. Hopefully the 2nd half of the series keeps up the pace and proves to be worth watching.<br /> <br />Update: Episodes 15-20 are pretty good. Things have definitely taken a darker turn in the series as it looks like the day of judgetment is now imminent. Episode 16 (Labyrinth) was actually a well done story focusing on Saiko Yuki. Episode 18 (Domull), Episode 19 (Back of a Coin) and Episode 20 (Love) are dark and troubling as the Lucifer Hawks really turn up the heat on Liquer Katsumi. The ending of episode 20 is a surprise and a nice plot twist.<br /> <br />Update #2: Hmm, plot holes.  What happened to the sword that used to call Katsumi, "My Master"?  We've seen the old dagger that Katsumi started with and Lum Cheng still has her sword.  Katsumi and the named sword used to be inseperable in the early episodes, yet it wasn't in the apartment with Roy and Katsumi in ep 20.
