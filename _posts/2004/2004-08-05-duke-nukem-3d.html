Dug back out my copy of Duke Nukem 3D a week or two ago.  A few years ago, 3DRealms released the source code (I think for the engine), and a small community has sprung up to port the old DOS/Win95 code so that it works on newer systems.  So, if you still have your old CD around, you can download the new engine and play it again!<br /><br />Such great fun, DN3D had a lot more "soul" then the other FPS games like Quake/Quake2 or Doom/Doom2 even with the lower quality graphics, because he's one sarcastic space marine with a ton of one liners.  Granted, the content of the game is "mature" (one level is the "red light district" and Duke swears like a sailor), but it's fun to go back and play something from 1996.<br /><br />When I attempted to install the game from the CD, only a few files went into C:\DUKE3D.  When this happens, go into your DN3DINST folder on the CD, and copy the contents of \DN3DINST\* to C:\DUKE3D\*.  You should end up with the DUKE3D.GRP file in the location C:\DUKE3D\DUKE3D.GRP.<br /><br />Then, grab a copy of <a href="http://jonof.edgenetwork.org/buildport/duke3d/">JonoF's Duke Nukem 3D port</a>.  Specifically, the file <a href="http://jonof.edgenetwork.org/downloads/index.php?cat=1">jfduke3d_20040629_r2.zip</a>.  Extract the contents to a temp folder, and then copy the files to your DUKE3D folder.  The new DUKE3D.EXE file should overwrite the old DUKE3D.EXE file and you'll also end up with a new sub-folder called "MODELS".<br /><br />Then run the C:\DUKE3D\SETUP.EXE file in order to setup your basic configuration.  Or you can use the in-game options menu.  I was able to re-configure mine so that it plays a lot like my Call of Duty key-layout (minus the ability to lean or go prone).<br /><br />There's also a hi-res texture pack in the forums, but I haven't tested that out yet.  I'd also like to find the 4th episode (came with a later version of the game).  But I still have 1.5 episodes left to play (halfway through the 2nd episode).
