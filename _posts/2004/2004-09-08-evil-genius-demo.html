Looks like <a href="http://www.reallifecomics.com/daily.php?strip_id=1273">Real Life Comics</a> has also stumbled across the Evil Genius demo.  I downloaded my copy from the GamersHell website (it's around 200MB, I think).<br /><br />Sorta a cross between The Sims, Sim City and Rollercoaster Tycoon.  Right now, it's on my "must buy" list, depending on the reviews when it comes out later in the year.  There are still some things in the demo that don't make sense (like quickly finding intruders or the petty thief without querying everyone).  Or why explosions keep happening in my secret lair.<br /><br />Oh, and if you can capture the petty thief and get him into the interrogation chair, you'll get quite a show by the guard who does the questioning.
