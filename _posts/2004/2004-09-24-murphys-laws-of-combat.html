<a href="http://sh.udm.ru/humor/e_combat.html">Murphy's Laws of Combat</a><br /><br />Some classics:<br /><br />7. Try to look unimportant; the enemy may be low on ammo and not want to waste a bullet on you.<br /><br />23. Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy other people to shoot at.<br /><br />25. Never draw fire; it irritates everyone around you.<br /><br />51. Sniper's motto: reach out and touch someone.<br /><br />55. When in doubt, empty your magazine.<br /><br />101. There is always a way, and it usually doesn't work.
