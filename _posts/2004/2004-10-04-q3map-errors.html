Well, my map is crashing during the VIS portion (using CoDBuilder).<br /><br />Error signature:<br />AppName: q3map.exe  <br />AppVer: 0.0.0.0  <br />ModName: q3map.exe<br />ModVer: 0.0.0.0  <br />Offset: 0002d27c<br /><br />I suspect it has to do with either a model that's out of place, or a brush that's funky.  Here's a sample from the compiler output (with verbose option turned on).<br /><br /><code>File Handles:<br />----------------------<br />30054 files in pk3 files<br />reading C:\Program Files\Call of Duty\Main\maps\mp\StorageBunkerD-006.bsp<br />reading C:\Program Files\Call of Duty\Main\maps\mp\StorageBunkerD-006.prt<br />    27 portalclusters<br />    36 numportals<br />   150 numfaces<br />    72 active portals<br />     0 hint portals<br />visdatasize:224<br />0...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9... (0)<br />      2 average number of passages per leaf<br />      0 MB required passage memory<br />0...1...2...3...4...</code><br /><br />At which point it crashes.  Once I dismiss the WinXP "app crashed" dialog (where you can opt to send info to Microsoft), the compile window continues on to the next steps and I can actually load and play the map.  Everything in the map looks normal and I can't seem to locate the error.  Probably crashing during what other versions call the "CreatePassages" section, but it doesn't say.<br /><br />So now I get to play the "delete stuff, try compiling" method of locating the error.  Started with a bunch of detail brushes (crates), then deleted some more, and more.  Finally, I deleted some models (chair, 2 trucks and a barrel) and then the map properly compiled.
