I'm getting dumped to the char select screen sometimes when I stand still for a few minutes.  It *might* be because I need to turn on <a href="http://www.rpgexpert.com/507.html">port triggering</a> on the LinkSys router.<br /><br />Not 100% sure if EQ2 uses the same ports (it probably doesn't), but I'll keep looking.  Plus, the RPG Expert article opens up *everything* which is overkill.<br /><br />Ah, here we go: <a href="http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=tech_support&message.id=625&highlight=port+triggering#M625">Port Forwarding Help for EQ2</a>.
