Dug out my old copy of SimCity4 recently. I may even update my Negishi region at some point (or place the files online for download again). I had to pull them in the past due to bandwidth issues, but I now have a lot more bandwidth then I used to.<br /><br />One of the big questions for me is figuring out transit speeds. Since I have the NAM mod installed, the pathfinding system is much better at locating the "fastest" path rather then just the "shortest" path.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.simcitycentral.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9667">List of transit times in SimCity 4</a><br /><br /><b>"Rail" Transit</b><br />200kph - Monorail<br />150kph - Subway / Elevated Rail<br />110kph - Passenger train<br /><br />Note: I've seen other place say that freight trains are 110kph and that passenger trains are 150kph.<br /><br /><b>Bus Transit</b><br />100kph - Highway<br />60kph - Avenue<br />46kph - Road / One-Way<br />31kph - Street<br /><br />Note: Bus transit speed is faster then cars so that the pathfinding algorithm prefers them over cars.<br /><br /><b>Cars</b> (and probably freight trucks)<br />82kph - Highway<br />40kph - Avenue<br />31kph - Road / One-Way<br />21kph - Street<br /><br /><b>Pedestrian Traffic</b><br />3.5kph - Avenue<br />3.5kph - Road / One-Way<br />3.5kph - Street
