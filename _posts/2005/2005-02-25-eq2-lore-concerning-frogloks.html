Found this while digging through my log files for information on the EQ2 froglok race (still has yet to be uncovered).<br /><br />The following passages are from either Commonlands Creature Catalog, Outside Freeport Creature Catalog, or a book about the sewers of Freeport.  One of the books contains a brief mention of Guk (where the froglok race fled to after being hounded by evil races before the shattering).<br /><br />I include the text here in case someone is googling for info on the frogloks.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Freeport was once known as "The City of Free Men" in the days before the Rending.  Ruled by Sir Lucan D'Lere, also known as the Overlord, the city of Freeport is still primarily inhabited by men, though it is also now home to many of the displaced folk of Norrath.  Craftsmen and adventurers still flock to this jewel by the sea.<br /><br />The continent of D'Lere is named for the Overlord.  Freeport is set in the Commonlands on an excellent deep water harbor.  It is believed to be the largest city to survive the Age of Cataclysms, although the inhabitants of Qeynos would beg to differ.  Beneath the city proper lies a sewer system that facilitates travel for those who wish to remain unseen.<br /><br />Freeport's weather is warm without becoming uncomfortable.  Due to its proximity to the sea, cooling breezes keep the warm air from the Commonlands from stagnating over the city.  The buildings in Freeport are tall, creating narrow lanes that occasionally prevent sun from reaching the street level.  In these man-made caverns, the air is much cooler than in the plazas.<br /><br />In some sections of the city, you will find rooftop gardens with herbs, lemon trees or flowers for cutting.  These areas are not visible from the street, however, and most travellers tend to view the patches of grass within the walls as the only greenery.  Freeport has never been a place of gardens and parks.<br /><br />The areas surrounding Freeport are home to a variety of unwholesome creatures.  One will find spiders and snakes aplenty, as well as dozens of rats.  Travellers need also be aware that orcs are sometimes found close in, and of course the usual thugs and ruffians are a universal threat to one's safety.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Before the Rending, the continent of D'Lere was part of a very large continent that included the cities of Qeynos, Freeport, Halas, Rivervale, Highhold, Oggok and Gukta.  Now its own region, D'Lere's southern section is known as the Commonlands.  This area was a major setting for the Battle of Defiance, during which the Overlord, Sir Lucan D'Lere, provided the necessary leadership for the men of Freeport to prevail over the Deathfist orcs.<br /><br />The Commonlands is situated on the southern half of D'Lere, separated from Nektulos by Razorrock Ridge.  While there are numerous nomadic camps in the plains, the region's major city is Freeport.  The Freewater Channel begins off the Commonlands' eastern shore, while the Tranquil Sea borders it to the south and southwest.<br /><br />Razorrock Ridge blocks the passage of cooling air from the north, which gives the air in the Commonlands a dry edge.  During the day, temperatures rise rapidly; it is necessary to pack in as much water as possible, as the ponds in the region are frequented by territorial creatures.  At night, the clear skies mean the temperature will fall quickly.  Due to the relative lack of humidity, frost is not a concern during Decay and rains are not prevalent during Growth or Harvest.<br /><br />The majority of the flora of the Commonlands is in the form of grasses, both long and short varieties.  Trees are more plentiful around the water holes, which can seem like an oasis in a desert of golden grass.  The sparse trees on the kopjes are usually from the acacia family, which go dormant during the long dry period after the last rains of Growth.  Flowers are limited to cornflowers and strawblossoms, although featherheads are occasionally seen at the bottom of muddy pools.<br /><br />Orcs have dominated the Commonlands for most of its history, although they were driven back during the Battle of Defiance.  In recent times, however, they are again presenting a nuisance to travellers through the region.  One will also encounter various scaled lizards and insects, such as basilisks and scorpions.  Predators lurk near any source of water, particularly savanna lions.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />The sewers beneath the streets of Freeport have long been a shadowed pathway for shadowy activities.  Despite the ravages of time, war and the sea, all levels of the Freeport sewer system are still functional.  In many areas, gnomish mechanical devices pump materials through the levels, finally pushing them out the last drains to the sea.<br /><br />There are three major sections of the Freeport sewer system.  Thieves' Way connects outlying districts to the city's heart through a series of narrow passages.  The Serpent's Sewer is a twisting maze of tunnels that channel debris and effluent from above to the Edgewater Drains.  The Drains are closest to the sea into which the sewers drain and so are mostly underwater.<br /><br />As with most underground areas, the Freeport sewers make up in smell what they lack in change.  Although the lowest tunnels are constantly washed by incoming tides, they are also the repository for much solid waste material.  This gives the sewers a noxious odor that lingers on one's clothing for many days after passing through the area.<br /><br />As the temperatures are so temperate, Antonica has a good season of Growth.  The fertile lands contain scattered farms with pastures and fields.  Trees are mainly deciduous oaks and maples in the valleys, while the hills are crowned by coniferous pines.  Beneath the shade of the trees one can find flowers such as violets, Tunare's breath and dwarf-bearded iris.  At night, one might be fortunate enough to find the rare night blooming gnoll's bane.<br /><br />Despite the smell, the sewers teem with life -- or forms of it.  Rats, bats, snakes and toads are plentiful throughout.  Additionally, one will encounter animated coagulated gelatins and in certain sections, skeletons.  The sewers are still used as pathways for those who wish to remain unnoticed, so those attempting a short cut will need to keep an eye to the shadows at all times.
