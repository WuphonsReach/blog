<a href="http://www.destroy-all-monsters.com/sacepisodeguide.shtml">Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex</a> - This site has reviews for the first 20 or so episodes of the first season (it's missing the last 6 eps).  Has a decent amount of information, especially trivia or a bit of backstory about odd cultural references.
