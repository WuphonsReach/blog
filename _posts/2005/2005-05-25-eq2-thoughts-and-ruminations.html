Thinking about the current design of classes in EQ2.  When you start, you have no class (or role) from level 1-2.  At level 3, you're forced to pick one of the 4 main archtypes (fighter, mage, priest, scout).  Then, at level 10 you pick your sub-class (3 for each archtype), and finally, at level 20, you pick your final type (usually a choice of only 1 based on your alignment, some sub-classes have 2 possibles).<br /><br />The problem I see with this is that the pace of the game in the first dozen levels is so fast that it's difficult to make a meaningful choice so early.  On the other hand, it makes rolling up alternate characters to experiment much quicker.<br /><br />If I was going to re-design it (wishful thinking):<br /><br />Levels 1-9 - no archtypes at all.  Leave the heroic opportunity system off the table until level 10+.  Give everyone the ability to do a little bit of everything, but nothing class-definining.  So, everyone could heal a bit, nuke a bit, and do a bit of melee damage.  Nothing like experimentation to decide which role you prefer.<br /><br />Level 10 - Now you pick an archtype (fighter, priest, mage, scout).  <br /><br />Level 20 - This would be the first sub-class level.  (Similar to the existing levels 10-19.)<br /><br />Level 30 - Pick your final class specialization.<br /><br />My thought is that by forcing everyone to pick an archtype at level 3, a sub-class at 10, and final class selection at 20, they compressed too much choice into too narrow of a range.  Expanding of the decision over an additional 10 levels would have given them a few benefits:<br /><br />- Players are better informed when it comes time to choose.<br /><br />- Easier class balance due to more levels at the lower end where you can introduce new spells.
