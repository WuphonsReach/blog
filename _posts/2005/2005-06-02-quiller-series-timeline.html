The Quiller series is one of those cold war delights.  A book series about an undercover british agent who goes very deep undercover behind the iron/bamboo curtains.  One turn of phrase used is "throwing the ferret down the hole to see what it can find out".  He's often completely cut off from any backup and has to rely on his wits and ability to evade the opposition to survive and escape. <br /><br />He's the anti-James Bond.  <br /><br /><a href="http://www.quiller.net/novels/main.html">Quiller Series (Adam Hall) timeline</a> - Lists the publish dates of the novels.<br /><br />The Berlin/Quiller Memorandum, 1965<br />The 9th Directive, 1966<br />The Striker Portfolio, 1968<br />The Warsaw Document, 1971<br />The Tango Briefing, 1973<br />The Mandarin Cypher, 1975<br />The Kobra Manifesto, 1976<br />The Sinkiang Executive, 1978<br />The Scorpion Signal, 1979<br />The Pekin/Peking Target, 1981<br />Northlight/Quiller, 1985<br />Quiller's Run, 1988<br />Quiller KGB, 1989<br />Quiller Barracuda, 1990<br />Quiller Bamboo, 1991<br />Quiller Solitaire, 1992<br />Quiller Meridian, 1993<br />Quiller Salamander, 1994<br />Quiller Balalaika, 1996
