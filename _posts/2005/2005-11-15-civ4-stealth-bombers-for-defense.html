Almost lost a city (or three) to a surprise attack by two different enemy civs this past week.  I had a pretty good defensive position, the southern half of a triangular peninsula.  But my southern cites were only lightly defended.  Most cities had a fighter plane, one modern unit and a handful of older outdated units that were due for upgrades.  In addition, I had a handful of stealth bombers sprinkled around various cities.<br /><br />When I went to war on my northern border, I was not really expecting the enemy to counter-attack by sea.  In hindsight, I should've expected it as I could not locate as many units as I thought would be defending territory.  So they sailed up to my shores and unloaded a large stack of invaders (roughly 6-9 units in the stack).<br /><br />There was no way that the defenders in my city would be able to dislodge such a beast of a stack.  Some of my defenders were still pre-gunpowder (although they got upgraded on the next turn to modern era units with my spare gold).<br /><br />Instead, I quickly rebased a few bombers to cities surrounding the invasion beachhead.  I also started moving modern units (thank goodness I had railroads already laid) in to the surrounding tiles and the city tile to reinforce the city and contain the invasion.<br /><br />While those reinforcements were getting into place and digging in, my stealth bombers flew multiple attack runs against the enemy stack (losing an aircraft about 1/8th of the time, getting it damaged about 1/3 of the time, and getting away scott-free the rest of the time).  By the time my counter-attack was ready, the enemy stack was down to half health for all units and my forces were able to mop them up handily.
