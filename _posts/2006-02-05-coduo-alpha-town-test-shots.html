Just two screen shots from a bit of mapping I was doing where I was considering creating a central town for a map.  The key idea was that there would be a river running up the middle of the city that tanks and vehicles could use as a travel path.<br /><br />Here's the T34 in the canal.  The water is 30u deep, which is about the maximum depth before you run into issues with players wading into it.<br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/AlphaTown/1Feb2006-shot0017.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/AlphaTown/thumb400/1Feb2006-shot0017.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - AlphaTown test shots - T34 in the canal" width="400" height="300" border="1"></a><br /><br />An overhead shot of the probable street locations.  Two vehicle crossings with a foot bridge in the middle.  You can see that the canal wall has been broken in two places to allow vehicles to exit the canal.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/AlphaTown/1Feb2006-shot0018.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/AlphaTown/thumb400/1Feb2006-shot0018.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - AlphaTown test shots - " width="400" height="300" border="1"></a><br /><br />Mostly, this was an experimental map.  I was experimenting with street sizes, how tall bridges needed to be, and whether a sewer system would work.  One thing I found out with the sewers is that forcing the player to crouch-walk for more then 300-500u is boring.  So I made the sewer tunnels tall enough that players could stand up inside and run/sprint.<br /><br />I also did not understand patches or terrain meshes when I created this map.  So everything was done with simple brushes.  That gets to be a bit of a pain when you're trying to do more realistic terrain.<br /><br />There's also the issue that I'm not sure how I would've portaled this map.  I wanted players to be able to get up onto rooftops, which was going to be tricky with frame rates.
