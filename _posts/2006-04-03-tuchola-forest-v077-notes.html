Upcoming v077 notes:<br /><br />- Moved the R3 pak gun. Right now, it's exposed but I plan on putting it inside a defensive works at that intersection.<br /><br />- Moved the Glacier Pass mortar. It won't reach R3, but it can at least cause havoc for the R3 pak gun and the defensive trench that will be around the R3 pak gun.<br /><br />- Added the 6th mortar. It's along the SE road. This mortar can shell the Hill 17 Radio Shack along with shelling R1 (not sure if it reaches the R1 pak gun). Basically, this mortar is a reward for the Germans if they take and hold the SE road U-bend. (Russians should be preventing germans from getting past the Southeast Bridge...)<br /><br />- Bleed through from the red lights in the bottom of the bunkers is driving me batty. I have yet to find a way to block that light from lighting up the surrounding snow from below.
