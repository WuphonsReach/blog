Known issues in v081:<br /><br />- There are sections of road that are colored incorrectly. That indicates that the road mesh is buggy and that I know about it. (Which means that vehicles go wonky as you drive over that section and that players can fall through or get stuck.) If you find a section of road that is buggy, but is textured with the road texture, please let me know.<br /><br />- The only known hole in the terrain is at the Southwest Bridge. There shouldn't be any other terrain holes in playable areas.<br /><br />- Edges of the map are not finished.<br /><br />- Inside of the Farm House is not finished.<br /><br />- Second floor of the Russian spawn area barn is not finished. Nor is the interior of the Russian spawn house or the tunnel beneath the house. There are two bunkers in the Russian spawn that still need detailed.<br /><br />- The G1 pak40 gun is not entrenched in fortifications yet.<br /><br />- Most treelines are missing their interior foliage.<br /><br />- The fence lines on the east side of the river in the Farm area are not finished.<br /><br />- I probably need one or two more satchel spawns.<br /><br />- The red lighting inside the bases is still being tuned (and toned down).<br /><br />- It currently rains in the basement of the bases... it is not indicative that the 100 year flood is imminent.<br /><br />- There may be a few places on the map with too much detail.
