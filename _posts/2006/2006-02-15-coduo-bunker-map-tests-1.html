This is a defensive position on the upper left corner of the map.  (What will be SE in the game, if I remember correctly.)  It is designed so that players can put a tank in hull-down position (almost "turret-down") while guarding the wooded road and the bridge in "http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/ of the position.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/7Feb2006-shot0021.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/7Feb2006-shot0021.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers Tests - Tank in hull-down emplacement." border="1" height="300" width="400" /></a><br /><br />Climbing up up on the hilltop behind the bunker / tank scrape.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/7Feb2006-shot0028.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/7Feb2006-shot0028.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers Tests - Defensive bunker" border="1" height="300" width="400" /></a><br /><br />Overhead shot of the defensive position.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/7Feb2006-shot0030.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/7Feb2006-shot0030.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers Tests - Overhead shot of the defensive position." border="1" height="300" width="400" /></a><br /><br />Note that all of this is early work.  The defensive position actually has some issues because the tank scrape is of such a long length that it blocks what would be guard slits at the front.<br /><br />My original goal was a hillside bunker with firing slits overlooking the bridge and the "T" junction along the side.  Players would be able to position portable MGs in the slits and defend against infantry trying to cross the bridge or at the intersection.<br /><br />The slits themselves are very long and thin.  This makes it almost impossible to drop shells into these bunkers from long range.  I haven't decided whether that is overpowering or not.  But since bunkers tend to be death traps, I prefer designs where a tank driver has to dismount to kill infantry inside a major bunker.<br /><br />This bunker has since been changed to a 5-room design, one room behind the tank scrape, and two rooms on either side of the tank scrape.  Overall, the bunker shape is a "U" with the tank in the middle of the "U".<br /><br />Hitting a tank in that position is rather difficult because the tank can retreat towards the back where it is almost completely hidden from view.  Which is good, because it's a static position (nowhere for the tank to go except into the field of fire).  If it proves to be overpowered, I'll change the front of the scrape to be lower, allowing easier targeting from the very front.
