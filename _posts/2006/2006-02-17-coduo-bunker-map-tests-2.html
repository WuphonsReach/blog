Here's some very early work from the BetaBunkers test map.  <br /><br />This is the north bridge with a Panzer IV driving across it.  You can see that the bridge is just wide enough for the tank.  The side walls are too high, although they provide a very nice "turret down" hiding spot for guarding the river approach.  (I later lowered these side walls a bit.)<br /><br />In the background of the first shot, you can see my placeholder "bunkers" which are probably where the bases will end up during a Base Assault game.  The german spawn is in the upper left side of the picture (a set of bunkers).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/14Feb2006-shot0034.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/14Feb2006-shot0034.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers Tests - North bridge with Panzer IV" width="400" height="300" border="1"></a><br /><br />Overhead view of the north bridge area.  The two tanks should give you an idea of scale.  All of the large flat sections will eventually be replaced by terrain mesh.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/14Feb2006-shot0048.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/14Feb2006-shot0048.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers Tests - Overhead view of the north bridge area" width="400" height="300" border="1"></a><br /><br />North bridge with Panzer IV passing underneath.  Verification that I could drive a map underneath the bridge.  This allows for some flexibility in play, where tanks can roll up the riverbed to avoid bottlenecks on the main roads.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/14Feb2006-shot0055.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/14Feb2006-shot0055.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers Tests - North bridge with Panzer IV passing underneath" width="400" height="300" border="1"></a>
