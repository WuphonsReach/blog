/devmap [mapname]<br />- Allows you to load a map in debug mode.<br /><br />/cg_drawFPS 2<br />- Shows you additional information, such as the number of tris / vertices / primatives / entities visible at the moment.<br /><br />/cg_drawshader 1<br />- Shows you the texture names under your crosshairs.<br /><br />/r_showportals 1<br />- Draws the portal boundaries, allowing you to see how the map was sectioned out.<br /><br />/r_showtris 2<br />- Draws the outlines of surfaces.  Useful for seeing how finely an area was divided.<br /><br />/r_showsurfcounts 1<br />- Shows the number of textures in use by a particular model.<br /><br />/r_showtricounts 1<br />- Shows the number of triangles in use by a particular model.  This is a good measure of model complexity.
