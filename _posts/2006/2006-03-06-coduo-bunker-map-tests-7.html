Two overhead shots.  Key thing to know is that north is DOWN and south is UP.  So the south forest area is at the top of the map.  German side is on the right, russians will spawn on the left.<br /><br />The first is an earlier version and is what you would see in Gradiant.  This was only about 15% complete.  The roads and river bed were selected to color them red.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/WinterMap15Pct.gif"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/WinterMap15Pct.gif" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers - Map Overviews" width="382" height="300" border="1"></a><br /><br />Here's a newer shot with texture colors added to the 2D view.  Purple splotches are the tree models.  Tan areas with dark brown cores are treelines (unpassable).  Large grey squares are the proposed base locations for Base Assault.  <br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/wintermap018.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/blog/Games/CallOfDuty/BetaBunkers/thumb400/wintermap018.jpg" alt="Call of Duty: United Offensive - Beta Bunkers - Map Overviews" width="397" height="300" border="1"></a>
