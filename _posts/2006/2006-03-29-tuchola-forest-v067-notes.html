Notes for v067 (Wed evening) - This was never posted.<br /><br />- Added HQ mode, server will now rotate between CNQ/BEL/HQ. Game lengths are all pretty short (<30 minutes). Only CNQ is longer due to being multi-round. The server is testing modifications to the HQ gametype (allowing additional CVars to control respawn wave time, max hold time, etc). Respawn waves are 20 seconds instead of the default 45 seconds, allowing for a more fluid HQ game.<br /><br />- Compass range is broken in HQ, I'll have to fix that in the server-side mod. It's sticking at 1024u when it needs to be 3000-5000u.<br /><br />- Points per rank on the test server is set to 5, so you will get arty pretty quick (at 20 points instead of 40 points).<br /><br />- Added more terrain on the german side. At least you can now get to all 3 bases without needing wings.<br /><br />- Fixed a lot of odds and ends such as messed up spawn points, broken textures.<br /><br />- Started adding "fake" trees in the treelines to spice them up. The best example is in the southeast corner of the map, near the southeast bridge's pak45 gun. Here's to hoping that they don't cause a compile error.
