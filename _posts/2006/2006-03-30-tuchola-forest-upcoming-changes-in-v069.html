More changes coming in v069 (or later)<br /><br />- The general idea behind anti-tank weapon spawns is that spawnpoints in the main team spawn areas will be on 10 second timers while weapon spots in forward battle areas will only be on 30 second timers. Ammo spawns in the bases will be on 15 sec timers. The faster respawn in the home territory allows spawning players to load up without excessive wait. The slower respawn in forward territory keeps infantry from holing up in a bunker with infinite ammo.<br /><br />- That design guideline also applies to satchel spawns. Ten seconds on the two spawns in each home area and thirty seconds for forward locations.<br /><br />- Adding two flamethrower spawns to the middle of the map. I know the young pyros get excited by all the lovely flames. I may add two more flamethrowers elsewhere.<br /><br />- Experimenting with smoke grenade spawns and binoc spawns. Not even sure if they can be handed out via ammo spawns.<br /><br />...<br /><br />More v069 notes<br /><br />- Cleaning up the treelines. Added the border foliage to make it more obvious where the borders of the map are. All of the short, white, spruce tree borders should be properly placed now.<br /><br />- Started reworking the interior of the treelines. While I haven't started putting the fake trees back in, I'm starting to make room for them by making the core of the treelines narrower.<br /><br />- Smoke grenade spawn definitely works. There won't be many of them and they'll be in out of the way places. Now you won't have to suicide to get more smoke grenades if you managed to evade an engagement. Plus, they'll be on a 60 sec respawn timer.<br /><br />- Added a bit more detail to the V2 launch sites. I'm debating adding a rocket ammo spawn to the North V2 Site, but I'll decide that once I add in the North Road Bunker. Instead, I may put a smoke grenade spawn inside one of the truck beds.<br /><br />- I'll be adding a foliage noise to the border foliage. If you get within 16u of a treeline wall, you'll make noise. (You almost have to be touching the wall to run afoul of this noisemaker.)
