Finally got my copy of <i>Order of the Stick, Dungeon Crawlin' Fools</i> in the mail. Most excellent.<br /><br />For those not in the know, Order of the Stick is a webcomic with an extremely clean (and well done) style about a party of adventurers.  The author / artist takes great liberty with the concept which results in a lot of fun inside jokes.<br /><br />Don't worry if you've never played D&D, there's enough other jokes there to keep you laughing.  And D&D jokes are somewhat self-explanatory anyway.<br /><br />The other nice thing is that it's a fairly clean comic.  About the worst part is the cartoon violence when the party does battles with the bad guys. <br /><br />Definitely worth the $25.
