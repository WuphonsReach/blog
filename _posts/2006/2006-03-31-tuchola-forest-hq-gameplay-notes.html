For HQ, I have the following points setup right now (going from memory):<br /><br />- The (4) bridges<br />- The South Forest Bunker (at the T-intersection)<br />- The (3) bunkers in the Farm area<br />- The south trench and the east trench in the farm area<br />- The two radio shacks (the SE one somewhat values infantry)<br />- The bunker surrounded by dragon's teeth near R2 (might delete this one)<br /><br />I could also add one up on the Glacier Pass in the westernmost ambush nook (near the North Bridge). And possibly a second one up on Glacier Pass in the middle nook between exits A and B.<br /><br />I definitely need to adjust where you can spawn during HQ (limiting players to spawning in the middle third of the map). However, I need to rebalance the CNQ spawn points first. The CNQ spawn points are TDM spawn points, so they get used in HQ. Since CNQ has the most spawn points of any gametype, I want to see where they end up before I setup HQ-specific spawn points.<br /><br />I may also revert the wave time to 30 sec. A lot of players don't understand the ebb and flow of HQ. Plus, I don't think the splash screen messages about the point totals are correct (they don't reflect what is in the config file).<br /><br />Due to the large size of the map, I've set the initial spawn delay on the HQ radio to 60 seconds. This means that the question mark will appear on the compass for a full minute before the radio actually shows up and can be setup. That gives both teams time to start heading towards the new radio objective. (It was like that last night, but the testers never got past the first radio position without complaining about the size of the map. So we rolled the map into CNQ instead.)<br /><br />So some of the complaints have to do with unfamiliarity of the map. Others are valid (such as having HQ radios towards the ends of the map rather then the middle). Some issues have to do with how I have the server configured (respawn wave time, point totals, etc).<br /><br />Other game balance things for HQ:<br /><br />I'm going to change the GSC file to change how points are awarded to the players. Right now, the default is that every player on the defending team (team in control of a radio) gets 3 points every wave. The attacking team players get 3 points once they destroy the radio.<br /><br />I'm going to change this to 1 point every wave tick for the defenders and 4 points for the attacking team once they destroy the radio. It doesn't change the outcome of the match (which is based on the # of seconds that you hold the radio) but it will get rid of some of the player score imbalances. Attackers basically get 3 ticks to get to and destroy the radio before their personal scores will start to fall behind the defender scores.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Reworked the HQ spawns... there are now only 29 spawns (instead of 280 due to using the CNQ's TDM spawns...). I'll need to add another few HQ/TDM spawns to the pool. None of the HQ spawns are on top of radio locations now. All of the HQ spawns are in the middle half of the map (nothing on the far ends). Most of them are close to jeeps or rocket ammo.<br /><br />Overall, there are 60 spawns for TDM/BEL (an additional 31 spawns that are not used in HQ). The CNQ spawns are a separate issue and not used in the other gametypes anymore. BEL needs a more widespread set of spawn locations in order to give the allied prey a chance to evade and escape after spawning.<br /><br />Basically, TDM spawns are used for BEL, CNQ, HQ and TDM gametypes. But I can limit them to a subset of the gametypes (such as making a spawn only work in CNQ or making it only work in BEL and TDM). So out of the 60 TDM spawns (not counting the CNQ-only spawns), 31 are used for BEL+TDM and 29 are use for all three gametypes.<br /><br />Even as I write this... I just went back and whacked a few of the TDM spawns that aren't used in HQ... (about half a dozen). That should allow for enough spawn variety in TDM/BEL without the lag issues that we were experiencing tonight.
