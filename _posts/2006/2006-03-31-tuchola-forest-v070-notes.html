v070<br /><br />Removing some of the HQ radio spawns. Mostly the ones on the east and west ends of the map. This will keep the action in the middle of the map for HQ. (It's a marginal HQ map due to the size. Putting radios on the ends made it worse. But then, folks play HQ on maps like Rhine Valley... so I'll leave the gametype in.) I may also turn off any spawn points that are on the ends of the map for HQ. That will push players towards the middle as well.<br /><br />HQ probably also needs more jeeps and light (fast) tanks rather then heavy / slow tanks.<br /><br />South Forest area needs more rocks (and more trees... if I can find some).<br /><br />Not sure if I'll leave the South Forest Bunker location in for CNQ. It's a very short distance from the two bridges, but it's also a logical capture point. I think I'll add some roadside trenches, some dragon's teeth and some hedgehogs to dress up the area.<br /><br />I need to fix the mortar position on the North Pass. The side walls and foliage are a bit too tall. It's too difficult to see the target areas.<br /><br />I'm hoping to get the german terrain finalized on Friday or Saturday. Then I can work on models and implementing base assault.<br /><br />CNQ spawn positions need work. Some are too far from the action.
