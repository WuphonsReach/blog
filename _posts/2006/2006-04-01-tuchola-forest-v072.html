v072 is up on the server<br /><br />- Finished adjusting the HQ spawn points and the TDM/BEL spawn points<br /><br />- Turned off vehicles in HQ.<br /><br />- Changed the default CNQ starting objective. The old starting goals were the Russian Ammo Dump (for the germans) and the Southeast Russian Base (for the Russians). I've changed the starting objective to be two spots farther away. Now the Germans will be attempting to take the South Radio Shack at the start of the round while the Russians attempt to take the Southeast Bridge at the start.
