During testing it's important that we play as many gametypes as possible. So we'll be running multiple gametype rotations throughout the testing phase. Part of my README for the server admins will be suggestions on what settings seem to work well for various gametypes on this map.<br /><br />Maybe during beta testing I'll run a more limited map set.<br /><br />BEL - is already mostly tweaked. But it's a blast to play and gives testers excuses to dive into all the nooks and crannies on the map. BEL also serves double-duty as testing for TDM (although I don't recommend that folks play TDM on a map of this size... but some folks might).<br /><br />HQ - We'll have to see how this plays out over the next few days. I've eliminated the tanks and shortened the max-hold time by 2/3s. And I changed the spawn points to be in the middle half of the map (not on the ends). It should be a vastly better experience now.<br /><br />CNQ - Still needs tweaked, mostly spawn point locations and jeep/tank locations. I'm curious whether folks think the 25 minute rounds are too long or too short. The server is setup with a 25 minute round limit and a 40 minute overall limit, best of 3 rounds format. (Unless the first two rounds run over 40 minutes, in which case CNQ will end in a tie.)<br /><br />Personally, I find that back-to-back 25 minute rounds are about right. CNQ tends to be very brutal and intense fighting. Less then 25 minutes and you won't have time to push the objective back and forth more then twice.<br /><br />If I can get the bonus objectives working, I think I'll set it so that the round ends if the bonus objective gets touched twice. (Making it worth 150 points or so with a 400 point limit.) The thing with the bonus objective is:<br /><br />- The bonus objective does not appear on the player's compass. Meaning they have to search around a bit while looking for something that they're not sure what they're looking for.<br /><br />- The bonus objective is an instant-click switch. So a suicidal attacker can run in and click the switch and get the bonus points. However, once clicked it can't be clicked again for another 5 minutes.<br /><br />I'm tempted not to put in bonus objectives at all.... except that they offer a way to end the round early because one team or the other got pushed all the way back to their spawn.<br /><br />A 24/7 CNQ server is probably a bit much. I think it will need to be split as CNQ/BAS to give players a more relaxing game inbetween the intense CNQ fighting.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I still haven't a clue where to put CTF flags. Anyone have ideas? One idea is at the German #2 and the Russian #2.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Other notes for upcoming releases:<br /><br />- Added an ammo box up on Glacier Pass at the mortar.<br /><br />- Added a small trench in the South Forest, with anti-tank ammo (30 sec respawn).<br /><br />- Added a kar98k spawn in the german spawn area. This allows players who want to use the portable MG to pickup a backup weapon rather then having to scrounge for one.<br /><br />- Added a mosin spawn in the russian spawn area. Same theory, give the portable MG folks a chance to pickup a rifle before they leave the spawn.<br /><br />- Added lamps inside most bunkers.<br /><br />- Added some portable MG brushes on top of the wooden defensive walls. There are still a lot of walls that need these brushes added (so that you can setup portable MGs on them).<br /><br />- More rocks and bushes in various spots.<br /><br />- All ruined tanks / vehicles should now have smoke effects (plumes of smoke rising from the wrecks).<br /><br />- Moved trees and rocks around in the South Forest again. I'm trying to get "clumps" of trees / rocks with more open areas in between.
