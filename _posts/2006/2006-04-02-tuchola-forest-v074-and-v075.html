More upcoming changes (v074):<br /><br />- Fixed the bonus objectives in CNQ. The instruction (hint text) on the bonus objectives should be a bit clearer.<br /><br />- Added the 3 ammo dump shelters (2 in the german spawn, 1 in the russian spawn) to serve as objectives for CNQ. I still have to dress it up a bit, but the majority of the decorations are in place for the german ammo dump.<br /><br />...<br /><br />v075 is up on the server. This is a final lighting compile (so the trees and models will cast shadows). As a result, the ambiance should be very different from what you normally see (forested areas will have more shadows).<br /><br />The big part of v075 is that the ruined bases are now solid and you can get down into the basements. I'm still working on making the shelves below solid (the horizontal pieces are solid by default, but the vertical pieces allow bullets/grenades through). I'm going to make the vertical pieces solid as well, but leave the very bottom (where the four poles are) as non-solid to weapon fire.<br /><br />The best example of the solid shelf vertical bits is the Russian #2 base.<br /><br />This is different then mp_foy or mp_uo_barbarossa. On those maps, the vertical sides of the shelves are non-solid and allow gunfire. This (to me) is counter-intuitive and should be fixed. If I can't see the stairs, you shouldn't be able to bounce a grenade off my chest or shoot me in the head. (Now you'll have to shoot my feet, or come around the side of the shelf.)<br /><br />I've used a metal weapon clip texture for the sides of the shelves. The sparks from bullets will make it very obvious that you're hitting the sides of the shelves instead of the player hiding behind.
