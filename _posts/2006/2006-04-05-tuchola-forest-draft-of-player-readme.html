DRAFT of the player README file (this file will be located inside the PK3 as well as inside the release ZIP)<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />Tuchola Forest 1945 - Multiplayer map for CoD:UO<br /><br />ALPHA TESTING VERSION 000 - APR 6 2006<br />(scrapyardbob@mobclan.com)<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />NO PART OF THIS PROJECT FILE, MAP .BSP, CUSTOM TEXTURES,<br />LOADING SCREENS, IN-GAME MAPS OR ANY OTHER CONTENT MAY BE<br />ALTERED IN ANY WAY FOR ANY PURPOSE WITHOUT MY EXPRESS<br />CONSENT. ANY SUCH ACTION WILL CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF<br />INTELLECTUAL COPYRIGHT.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />ALPHA TESTING NOTES:<br /><br />Since this is an alpha test version, please do not host this on public clan servers. Revisions will be happening on a daily basis and you will be constantly chasing your tail trying to keep up with the latest alpha version. It is best for everyone if you come to the Tuchola Forest Alpha Test server to play with other alpha testers.<br /><br />Please leave any and all feedback / bug reports in the {MOB} forums. You can find the latest feedback thread at:<br /><br />http://www.mobclan.com/forums/upload/index.php?showforum=73<br /><br />If you have screenshots or demo files of problem areas, please e-mail them to scrapyardbob@mobclan.com. Please be sure to include enough contextual information in your screenshot (rather then focusing tightly in on the problem area) so that I can locate these spots in the map. Locational information (using the console, type /viewpos) is also extremely helpful. Bugs that might warrant a screenshot:<br /><br />- Messed up textures<br />- An abnormally high vert/tri count (/cg_drawFPS 2)<br />- Terrain holes<br />- Exploitable glitches (get in behind the treelines, inside of models, or other exploits)<br />- Other things that are too complicated to describe in the forums<br /><br />If you need help recording demos, see:<br /><br />http://www.mobclan.com/forums/upload/index...?showtopic=7047<br /><br />The latest information about test changes can be found at:<br /><br />http://www.mobclan.com/forums/upload/index.php?showforum=73<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />CLIENT REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES:<br /><br />1) THE AFTER-HOURZ VEHICLE PACK IS REQUIRED ON YOUR MACHINE<br /><br />This map requires that the server and any players have the After-Hourz vehicle pack on their machines. You can find the AHz vehicle pack at:<br /><br />http://www.after-hourz.com/cod/BarbVehicles.php<br /><br />If you have played maps like Ardennes 1944, Barbarossa or Smolensk then you will already have the necessary PK3 installed on your machine (z_ahz_vehicles.pk3).<br /><br />2) If you encounter the "hunkmegs" error, use the following to increase your hunkmegs setting:<br /><br />(press the tilde key "~")<br />Type this into the console: /seta com_hunkmegs "256"<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />CREDITS:<br /><br />The After-Hourz vehicles and the Conquest gametype were developed by the After-Hourz crew (and known associates). They are a great resource to the CoD:UO mapping community.<br /><br />Slyk has been invaluable at answering technical questions that I've had for my first public mapping project. In addition, I've learned a lot about mapping and portalling by closely examining how Slyk constructed his Barbarossa and Smolensk maps.<br /><br />A big thanks to everyone at {MOB} who were willing to help test the map when it was still in an unfinished state. Even though gametypes like HQ / BEL are not their favorite gametypes, they never complained but slogged through and helped me to find bugs, errors and gameplay issues. Without alpha testers, the map would never have been as balanced or fine-tuned as it is today.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------
