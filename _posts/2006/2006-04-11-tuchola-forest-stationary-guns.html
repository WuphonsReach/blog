There are (7) paks on the map, one for each base and the Russians get a bonus pak that guards the SE bridge.<br /><br />G1 pak40 - Currently sitting naked on the hilltop. It will probably get a fortification similar to the G2 pak40. Artillery or snipers can easily wipe out this defensive position. Tough to flank, but I plan on allowing infantry to sneak the S wall from the river to the pak position. I'm still evaluating what all is going to happen around G1.<br /><br />G2 pak40 - This is a tougher one to silence, but there are quite a few spots where Russians can snipe the gunner. G2 has a wide front to cover, so a simultanous attack from both flanks would allow one team or the other to get a side shot on the gunner. I may add one or two trees to obscure it's coverage area, but that also works against attackers (as the pak40 gunner can fire blindly).<br /><br />G3 pak40 - Probably the toughest of all. Attacking this pak position head on is suicidal. It should either be softened up with arty, or use snipers to take care of the gunner. I may lower the wall in front of the pak40 slightly to make the pak easier to hit. Infantry scouts can also sneak up the north wall, through the V2 launch area without being seen. This gets you behind the pak position where you can kill the gunner (or a tank in the tank scrape on top of the hill).<br /><br />The power of G3's pak is balanced by the issue that Germans have a tough time re-taking this hill. Once you drive the Germans off of this hill, you should be able to hold it against German reinforcements. We'll see how it plays out over the next week.<br /><br />R1 pak45 - A bit naked on the hill above R1. Vulnerable to snipers on Hill 13 or at the radio shack in the Hill 17 area. The Hill 13 mortar position can also be used to drop rounds onto the gunner's head.<br /><br />R2 pak45 - This gun used to sit on the bunker roof where the mortar now is (it was way overpowered there). Shouldn't be too many complaints about this pak other then it's tough to stay alive while using it. (I may put a wall next to it.) So far, the R2 pak dosn't get a lot of use and may need some assistance.<br /><br />R3 pak45 - Sniper bait. Also mortar bait if you use the Glacier Trail mortar position (which is specifically designed to hit that pak45 position!).<br /><br />SE Bridge pak45 - Helps the russian's hold the Southeast Bridge (a worthwhile cause for the Russians). More of a nasty surprise then a defendable position.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Of the seven paks, the G3 is probably the worst. The G1 pak will become less effective over time as I detail the area around G1. G3 is pretty much set, other then possibly lowering the hill in front of the pak40.
