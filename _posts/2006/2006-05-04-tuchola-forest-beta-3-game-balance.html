The initial settings were 35 min rounds, 60 min overall limit which resulted in a lot of bonus 3rd rounds.<br /><br />- Beta #2 has been running with 35 min rounds and a 45 min overall limit which typically limits the game to 2 rounds.<br /><br />- Rounds with fewer players tend to be short rounds, rounds with more players tend towards longer rounds. (Based on anecdotal observations.)<br /><br /><b>Bases breached:</b><br /><br />Beta #1: 1304 (11.1/match), 653 by axis, 651 by allies<br />Beta #2: 3358 (8.6/match), 1702 by axis, 1656 by allies<br /><br />- The disparity between 11.1/match and 8.6/match can be explained mostly by the changes in the server settings. There are far fewer 3-round matches during the Beta #2 time period due to config changes. A better metric may be the number of bases breached per hour of play.<br /><br />Beta #1: 1304 over 6 days = 217/day<br />Beta #2: 3358 over 16 days = 210/day<br /><br />- But that makes assumptions that the server was full 24/7, which it isn't. So that's not a good metric either.<br /><br />- Unfortunately, there's no good way to pull out the number of played rounds. The Base Assault logic reports the intermission and warm-up time periods as "rounds" even though they aren't rounds that get played.<br /><br />- So, the axis vs allies breach quantity is the only useful metric.<br /><br /><b>Number of plant attempts:</b><br /><br />Beta #1: 1588 (13.6/match), 798 by axis, 790 by allies<br />Beta #2: 4082 (10.4/match), 2074 by axis, 2008 by allies<br /><br />- Approximately even plant attempts. Russians seem to have a slightly more difficult time keeping Germans out of their bases.<br /><br /><b>Bases Destroyed:</b><br /><br />Beta #1: 975 (8.3/match), 497 by axis, 478 by allies<br />Beta #2: 2362 (6.0/match), 1166 by axis, 1196 by allies<br /><br />- Allies turned the tables in Beta #2, destroying slightly more bases then the axis. Unsure whether this was due to more {MOB} members playing on the Allies team then the Axis team.<br /><br />- It's still a very close thing. A single squad (2-4 players), working together, can have a very large effect on the outcome of the game.<br /><br /><b>Percentage of plants which succeed:</b><br /><br />Beta #1: 61.4% overall, 62.3% for axis plants, 60.5% for allied plants<br />Beta #2: 57.9% overall, 56.2% for axis plants, 59.6% for allied plants<br /><br />- One thing that can affect this metric is lone-wolf plants (which usually fail). Some bases are more inviting for attempts by lone-wolf players then others.<br /><br />- I'm not sure whether the Axis are at a disadvantage. A lot of {MOB} members tend to play as allies which could account for the lower success rate of German plant efforts.
