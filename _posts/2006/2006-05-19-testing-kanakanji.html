Dunno how well this works in Blogger's tool.  The IME doesn't seem to work inside this.<br /><br />??????(konban wa)<br />??????? (oyasumi nasai)<br /><br />I actually had to compose those in another application, then past them in.<br /><br />And... they display as all ?????s.  Probably because I don't have the proper language setting in the &lt;HEAD&gt; element.  Mmm, nope, Blogger chokse on them entirely.  Looking at the HTML source generated, it converted them to ?????s.<br /><br />Oddly enough, they show up properly inside of the Blogger edit window.
