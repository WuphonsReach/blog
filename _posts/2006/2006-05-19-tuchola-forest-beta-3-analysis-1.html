Looking at the 14 days of log files from the release of Beta #3 until I changed the time limit to 45 minutes (from 35 minutes).  Specifically, log file 05042006_0629 to 05182006_0629.<br /><br />First up is the search for "ExitLevel: executed" which gives me a count of the number of matches played over the 14 days.  There are 315 occurences which is 22.5 matches/day or around 64 minutes/match.  It's not possible to get round lengths because the log files don't differentiate between intermission rounds and actual rounds within a match.<br /><br />Next, I search for ";bas_breached" to find the # of times bases are breached, broken down by the number of lines containing ";axis;" which are lines where an axis team member breached an allied base.  Repeat this for ";bas_planted" and ";bas_destroyed".<br /><br />2189 bases breached, 1087 by axis, 1102 by allies<br />2727 plant attempts, 1359 by axis, 1368 by allies<br />1515 bases destroyed, 722 by axis, 793 by allies<br />56% success, 53% for axis plants, 58% for allied plants<br /><br />So that shows a very slight bias towards allies on the map.
