Next up is the past 8 days (05192006_0629 to 05262006_0629) which covers 5/18 to 5/25 after the time limit was changed to 45 minutes/round.  Some of the log file sizes look funky, so the match length estimate might be a bit "off".<br /><br />159 matches over 8 days = 72 min/matches<br /><br />Looking only at the last 4 days of log files<br /><br />97 matches over 4 days = 59 min/round<br /><br />Whee, a big amount of wiggle room in those numbers... onward to the more solid numbers.<br /><br />...<br /><br />1566 bases breached, 745 by axis, 821 by allies<br />2000 plant attempts, 964 by axis, 1036 by allies<br />1193 bases destroyed, 535 by axis, 658 by allies<br />60% success rate, 55% for axis plants, 64% for allied plants<br /><br />Hmm... definitely a bit more bias towards the allies over the past week of gameplay.
