Finally installed Frotz on my linux server and downloaded the <a href="http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html">free copies of Zork from Infocom</a>.  <br /><br />Brings back memories (I got a chance to play the original Zork back in the early-80s).<br /><br />Maybe I'll setup guest accounts for friends who want to play...
