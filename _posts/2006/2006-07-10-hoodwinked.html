I picked this up from the bargain bin this week.  It's a 3D animated film that I hadn't heard about and ran across in some random fashion.  If you can get past the slightly sub-par animation you get a film that is a very unique take on the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tail.  (In listening to the DVD commentary, you find out that due to the low budget of the film, they went for a "stop motion" animation style rather then the fluid animation of Pixar's work.)<br /><br />The plot is a 4-way P.O.V. style affair where the 4 principle characters (the wolf, granny, little red and the woodsman) retell their side of the story after being detained due to domestic disturbance by the local police force.  Nothing is entirely what it seems and the 4 tales weave together in an interesting fashion to reveal the actual villan of the story (the "goody bandit").  Up until the 4th retelling, I still suspected the main characters.  So they do a good job of muddying the waters.<br /><br />Well worth a rental or purchase if you like slightly off-beat takes on established classics.<br /><br />And for fun, here's the villan's checklist (in ROT13):<br /><br />(purpx) Gnxr qbja Zhssva Zna<br />(purpx) Ehva Erq<br />(purpx) Npg phgr naq shmml<br />(abg qbar) Fgrny erpvcr obbx!!<br />(purpx) Fraq jbys ba tbbfr punfr<br />(abg qbar) Cvpx hc qel pyrnavat<br />(purpx) Cnl rivy fxv grnz<br />(abg qbar) Cnl tnf ovyy<br />(abg qbar) Pnyy zbz<br />(abg qbar) Svavfu ynve
