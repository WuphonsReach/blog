Pulled these numbers off a spec sheet for a Seagate 750GB Perpendicular Recording drive.<br /><br /># Number of Discs (physical) 4<br /># Number of Heads (physical) 8<br /># Bytes Per Sector 512<br /># Areal Density (Mbits/sq in) 128,200 Mbits/square inch<br /># Track Density (TPI) 145,000 tracks/inch<br /># Recording Density (BPI, max) 926,000 bits/inch<br /># Recording Components<br /># Recording Method Perpendicular<br /><br />I don't remember what the Areal density of the older drives are off-hand.
