I've been flirting with the idea of looking into <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/">Eve Online</a>.  Because I want something new to muck with and I hear that Eve doesn't have the grind as bad as traditional MMOGs.  In fact, when you're training a skill it happens in real-time, even if you're offline.<br /><br />The download for the client is around 600MB.  Pricing is pretty standard $11-$15/mo (there's a quarterly billing option that I'll probably go with).  No start-up fee and I found a 14-day trial code.<br /><br />I don't know that I can categorize it, except that it's based around ships in a 3D environment (you never leave your ship).  The makers of Eve pretty much stay out of the way and merely provide the base capabilities of the game (to keep scamming using exploits to a minimum).  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVE_Online">Wikipedia entry</a> does a decent job of giving an intro.<br /><br />A key image to look at is the <a href="http://www.eve-files.com/media/12/eve_chart-rmr.jpg">scale comparison chart of the ships</a>.  That's one of the things that attracts me.<br /><br />I'll post some images later.
