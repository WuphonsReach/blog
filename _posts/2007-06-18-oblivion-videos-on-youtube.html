I've been playing a bit of Oblivion the past few weeks.  While it's a real bear to get running at anything approaching decent resolution (1280x720 is still a bit choppy, even on a SLI GeForce 7950 rig), it's very involving.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyHiIeBsc9E">Oblivion Domino Day</a> - Hopefully someone did this with the CE (Construction Editor) and not in-game, because it's nigh impossible to place books accurately in-game.  The NPC that they're killing is the "Adoring Fan".  Reportedly one of the most annoying NPCs in the game.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_BRdgY8lvM">Oblivion Domino Day II</a> - Same thing, different setup.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3SE7BQFHX4">Oblivion Fun</a> - First a dive off of "Dive Rock".  Followed by lots of jumping and getting outside the walls of Imperial City.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhpSAbMk6hE">Oblivion Fun</a> - A continuation of the above.  More fun with "Dive Rock".  Followed on by fun with spells.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo_8b2nShzE">Oblivion Fun</a> - More fun with Havoc physics.  Features Cloud Ruler Temple.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhgpC5DitIE">A Brush With Death</a> - Shows the entirety of the "A Brush With Death" quest, which is one of the wildest landscapes (even though it's imaginary).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HtHZMQXeU">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - Gameplay Footage</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWF99a6UuL4">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Review</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7f3PUhoVLc">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Review</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCcTfVsszNs">Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of the Nine - Review</a><br /><br />On the whole, Oblivion scores about a 80/100.  Once you heavily mod it, it makes a lot more sense and plays better.  But you'll still have to deal with semi-frequent crashes, video glitches, and a AI that isn't always the smartest.  Once the GeForce 8800/8900 cards get down around $100, plan on setting up a SLI rig and giving this a play.  Until then, you're going to have issues with framerates.<br /><br />Specifically, you should install <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65abKSTD0_s">Obsuro's Overhaul</a> for a better gameplay.
