And a pair of images after getting out of the tutorial stuff.<br /><br />The first picture is my Caldari Bantam, which I use for mining.  Has decent cargo capacity for a newbie craft (3x more then my first rookie ship) but is rather slow for a frigate.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/EveOnline/2006/12/2006.12.31.08.57.12.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/EveOnline/2006/12/thumb640/2006.12.31.08.57.12.jpg" alt="Eve Online - Dec 2006" width="640" height="400" border="1"></a><br /><br />The second image here is my Caldari Condor, which is a very fast frigate that I use for small errands in other star systems.  Very inexpensive to outfit.  More useful then a shuttle due to the larger cargo capacity.  I'm currently training up to use a small 1NM Microwarp Drive I (MWD), but that training plan will take 3 days to complete.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/EveOnline/2006/12/2007.01.01.23.32.38.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/EveOnline/2006/12/thumb640/2007.01.01.23.32.38.jpg" alt="Eve Online - Dec 2006" width="640" height="400" border="1"></a>
