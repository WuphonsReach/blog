Note: Obscuro's Oblivion Overhaul (OOO) or one of the other mods that I have installed plays with ingredient weights.  So the un-modified version of Oblivion will result in higher potion weights.  Note that the first potion of a particular name and strength sets the weight for all other potions created under that particular name and strength.  So use the lightest weight ingredients first (make a single potion) then use heavier ingredients until you see the potion effects change (when your Alchemy skill increases).<br /><br />Any listed effects were calculated at Alchemy level 83 (with Luck of 85).  I try not to list any rare or hard to obtain ingredients in my lists.  I'm using Expert level Alchemy equipment (except for a Master level Retort)<br /><br /><b>Poison (Caster, Fire)</b> (0.075 best weight)<br />- Combine Harrada (0.1), Spiddal Stick (0.1), Steel-Blue Entoloma Cap (0.1) and Bergamot Seeds (0.0)<br />- Damage Health: 7 pts for 28 sec, Damage Magicka 13 pts for 52 sec, Fire Damage: 8 pts for 34 sec, Silence for 23 sec<br />- A nice lightweight potion that can be used to great effect against casters.<br /><br /><b>Poison (Caster, Frost)</b> <br />- Combine Black Tar (0.1), Harrada (0.1), <br /><br /><b>Poison (Caster, Shock)</b> (0.1 weight)<br />- Combine Black Tar (0.1), Harrada (0.1), Ectoplasm (0.1), and Rot Scale (0.1)<br />- Damage Health: 7 pts for 28 sec, Shock Damage: 8 pts for 33 sec, Silence: 24 sec, Paralyze: 3 sec<br />- Although it's a small pain to obtain the ingredients, it's useful in cases where you want to knock down (paralyze) an opponent.<br /><br /><b>Restore Magicka</b> (0.0 weight)<br />- Combine Blackberry (0.0) with Water Hyacinth Nectar (0.0)<br />- Restore Magicka: 19 pts for 67 sec<br /><br /><b>Restoration (Feather & Shield)</b> (0.075 best weight)<br />- Combine Aloe Vera Leaves (0.1), Flax Seeds (0.0), Lady's Mantle Leaves (0.1) and Withering Moon (0.1)<br />- Feather: 233 pts for 829 sec, Shield: 45% for 159 sec, Restore Health: 11 pts for 40 sec, Restore Magicka: 19 pts for 67 sec<br />- A very powerful potion of restoration.<br /><br /><b>Restoration (Dispel)</b> (0.1 weight)<br />- Combine Fly Amanita Cap (0.1), Grapes (0.1), Lady's Mantle Leaves (0.1) and Tobacco (0.1)<br />- Restore Health: 11 pts for 40 sec, Restore Fatigue: 25 pts for 87 sec, Dispel: 103 pts on self<br /><br /><b>Fortification (Magic + Endurance)</b>
