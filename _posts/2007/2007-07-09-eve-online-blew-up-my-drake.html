So earlier this week, I started running level 3 missions in earnest.  There's a definite step up in difficulty, loyalty points, reward ISK, and bounties between L2s and L3s.  Things were going well, until I was working on a 10-part storyline mission.  The last (10th) mission in the series involves a very nasty fleet battle with 6+ battleships, multiple battlecruisers and cruisers, and some frigates.  <br /><br />I had managed to pick off about half of the fleet (aggro a clump, fly directly away), but made a mistake when I went back to get another group.  Instead of flying away towards a distant celestial object, I was aimed towards the nether regions of space.  So when my Drake started getting pounded hard, I couldn't find anything to warp out to quickly enough to avoid destruction.<br /><br />Between insurance for the hull, minus what I paid to insure a new hull and lost fittings, it was a 20-30M ISK mistake.  On the other hand, I had made about 15-20M ISK on the storyline so far (killing those battleships with 1.2M ISK bounties helped).  And the storyline mission resulted in a <b>massive</b> boost to my standings with the storyline agent.  So on the whole, it was a minor setback not a major one.<br /><br />But I'm definitely feeling a bit poorer this week.
