Moon Guard is both a role-play (RP) server as well as a relatively young server (6-9 months?).  So the population is somewhat low, yet a lot of folks have already made it to level 70.  Still, there seem to be some established guilds that I have my eye on applying to once I hit level 20 (which is the usual minimum level for most guilds).  So, in no particular order:<br /><br /><b>Glory</b> (<a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Moon+Guard&n=Glory&p=1">WoWArmory</a> - <a href="http://glory.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=204030&TabID=1722267">Website</a>)<br />- 127 members (a lot of 70s, but 30-40 below level 40)<br />- Recruitment was closed last week but is now open on a case-by-case basis<br />- Casual RP, but heavy raiding<br /><br /><b>Rune</b> (<a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Moon+Guard&n=Rune&p=1">WoWArmory</a> - <a href="http://runemoonguard.guildlaunch.com/">Website</a>)<br />- 88 members (roughly 30% below level 40)<br />- Recruitment currently suspended<br />- Medium RP, casual raiding<br /><br /><b>Veritas</b> (<a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Moon+Guard&n=Veritas&p=1">WoWArmory</a> - <a href="http://www.veritas-mg.com/">Website</a>)<br />- 66 members, with a large number in the 20-40 range<br />- Medium to heavy RP, with a raiding as a secondary priority<br />- Fully fleshed out website<br />- Members must be at least age 22 (in real life)<br /><br /><b>Raiders of the Lost Rum</b> (<a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Moon+Guard&n=Raiders+of+the+Lost+Rum&p=1">WoWArmory</a> - <a href="http://rum.stevezero.com/cgi/index.cgi">Website</a>)<br />- Recently absorbed The Boonies guild<br />- No/Light RP, casual approach to raids<br />- 203 members, about 45% below level 40<br />- Piraty theme<br /><br /><b>Maelstrom</b> (<a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Moon+Guard&n=Maelstrom&p=1">WoWArmory</a> - <a href="http://www.guilduniverse.com/maelstrom_mg/default.aspx">Website</a>)<br />- 92 members, 30% below level 40<br />- Minimum level to join is 20<br />- RP medium/heavy, light raiding<br />- Probably a good fit for me<br /><br />My criteria at the moment for guilds that I'm considering are:<br /><br />- Posted in the <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=69371&sid=1">Moon Guard forums</a> sticky thread.  Which shows that they are somewhat organized.  That tends to weed out the "here today gone tomorrow" guilds because you can look at the date when they posted to the guild thread.<br /><br />- Have a website.  While some role-play guilds may consider it out of character (OOC), an out-of-game forum for discussions and to keep track of events is helpful.  Again, it shows at least some level of organization if they have a website up and running.  Often the website pages give insight into the character of the guild.<br /><br />- Openly inviting new players to the server.<br /><br />- Maturity (I don't care for teen angst)<br /><br />- Provides assistance towards others
