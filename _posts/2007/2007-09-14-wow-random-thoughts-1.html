So my brother finally figured out my priest's character name last night (Corish).  What he was doing up at 2am, I'm not sure... the only reason I was up that late was so that I could meet with an officer from Maelstrom at one of the drinking establishments in Stormwind's Old Town.  It went well, I'm now guild tagged and happy to be tagged.  This weekend I'll get a chance to hopefully meet some more of my new guildmates.<br /><br />The interview was partially done in-character (IC) and partially done out-of-character (OOC).  Maelstrom's officer invited me to a group so that I could ask OOC questions in /party while we asked IC questions in /say and /emote.  It took about 45 minutes to an hour.  As she said, role-play is a lot about stopping and smelling the roses.  Which is something that I'm not always good at (I get focused on goals to the exclusion of all else).<br /><br />I'm really surprised that the auction house interface hasn't been improved at all since the start (search results not sorting properly across multiple pages, not being able to put up a 3 day or 7 day auction, etc.).  Oh well, I manage to sell about 75% of what I put up for auction within the first 24h window, so I'm not terribly annoyed by it yet.  And I won my first long duration auction last night for a 12-slot bag for around 75-80sp.<br /><br />Loot drops in WoW are interesting.  You get a lot of decent gear off of random trash mobs, even gear with stats, rather then it only dropping off of "named" or "boss" mobs.  That's a good choice for a MMO, in my opinion, because it lessens the likelyhood that players will over-camp a particular spot.  Now, it may be because Moon Guard is a low population server, but I have yet to see much competition for spawns.  Anyway, last night's "odd" drop was a 8-slot leather bag from a level 20 spider.<br /><br />Now that Corish has hit level 22, I should probably go shopping in the AH for a better wand (it's been 5 levels since I bought the last one) and a few better pieces of gear.  I'm still having trouble finding anything for my head, neck, shoulders, wrist and trinket slots.  I won't say that I have bad gear or good gear... I have managed to kill a level 23 named spider at level 21 (I didn't notice the name until I pulled it).  And I later killed a level 24 named boar (again at level 21), but that fight required a few potions.  So my gear is good enough to get the job done when soloing, even against mobs that are 2 levels higher.
