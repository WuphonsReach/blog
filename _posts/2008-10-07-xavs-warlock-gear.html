So, as we approach Wrath of the Lich King release (probably Nov 13th), I'm trying to streamline and figure out exactly what I need for Xav's warlock gear using the badges that we're getting by running Karazhan each week.  (Usually at least 11 badges, sometimes as many as 20 in a single night.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Moon+Guard&n=Xavron">Her gear is pretty good.</a>  And she even has a set of PvP gear that she uses in the Battlegrounds.<br /><br />When the 3.0.2 patch comes out, she'll only need 164 spell hit instead of the 202 spell hit.  So I've been trading off from my high of 180 spell hit and slowly working my way down to the 164 number (anything in 160-164 range should be fine).<br /><br /><b>1H Weapons:</b><br /><br />Not a whole lot of choices here.  A lot of the mages want the drop off of Prince in Karazhan, so I'll probably lose out on a roll there.  The only dagger that's worthwhile is a 150-badge purchase from the Smith, and that's an awful lot of badges.<br /><br />If I can farm the honor points in Alterac Valley, and get 3 more EotS marks, I'll probably buy the Gladiator's Spellblade for PvP (and possibly for PvE).  I already have about 11k honor points, and the blade 25k.<br /><br />Alternately I could try to get to exalted with Honor Hold for their blade.  If I can get enough spell hit in other areas, I may be able to go after some of the other 1H daggers/swords.<br /><br /><b>Wands</b><br /><br />Only possibles here are the drop off of Aran in Karazhan.  Or the 25-badge wand, which has a blue socket and is a strong contender.  The wand is very tempting... inexpensive and has a socket.<br /><br /><b>Back (Cloak)</b><br /><br />60-badge Cloak of Subjugated Power.<br />Alternately, there's a drop off of Prince in Karazhan, but I don't like the look.<br /><br /><b>Chest</b><br /><br />My T4 chest item drops off of Mag.  Not sure how often we'll be doing Mag, so I doubt that I'll see it.<br /><br />There's a 100-badge robe that looks nice and warlocky.<br /><br />Or the Robe of the Elder Scribes off of Nightbane.  But I usually get stuck healing with Corish on that fight.<br /><br /><b>PvP Gear</b><br /><br />I have a few pieces of PvP gear already, but I should look at:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Vindicator%27s_PvP_rewards">Vindicator's PvP rewards</a><br /><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Merciless_Gladiator%27s_Dreadgear">Merciless Gladiator's Dreadgear</a>
