So I dug back into Dragon's Dawn (Anne McCaffrey's Pern series) this week.  The book is a lot shorter then I remembered, and it rushes at a head-long pace towards a pretty so-so conclusion.  I think my problems with it were:<br /><br />- Too hard to identify the protagonists, and then keep them straight.  There were a lot of story threads going on at the same time, which made it difficult.  We really needed to spend a longer time with each protagonist before the story thread jumped to yet another person.<br /><br />- Pacing.  Disaster piled upon disaster piled on top of yet another disaster.  Which would have been a lot more interesting, had there been more pages between.<br /><br />- Scattered focus.  I think this goes hand-in-hand with having too many protagonists, all introduced at the same time.<br /><br />I'll still probably plow ahead with the series, hopefully the author learned from her mistakes.  But since Dragon's Dawn was published in 1988, at about the mid-point of the author's career, I'm not overly hopeful.<br /><br />(It may simply be that I prefer the works and writing style of C. J. Cherryh or Lois McMaster Bujold.)
