I'm getting ready to push Corish to 70, but I also want to see if I can arrive at 70 ready to create a set of PMC gear.  I say "set" because there are pieces that go together (belt, robe, shoulders), but it's not a full-fledged set with 5+ pieces. Naturally, it helps if you complete the following quest:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Quest:Becoming_a_Mooncloth_Tailor">Becoming a Mooncloth Tailor</a><br /><br />This quest results in the ability to create two pieces of PMC from the materials instead of just one (but you can only have a single specialization).<br /><br />So, how much material do you need to create a PMC set? Lots!<br /><br />Each piece of PMC (assuming that you didn't specialize in mooncloth) requires (1) bolt of imbued netherweave, (1) Primal Water and (1) Primal Life. This breaks down into the following source components:<br /><br />(10) motes of life<br />(10) motes of water<br />(18) Netherweave Cloth (3 bolts)<br />(2) Arcane Dust<br /><br />A) Primal Mooncloth Belt (355 tailoring) - (4) PMC (2) Netherweb Spider Silk (8) Primal Life<br />- (2) Netherweb Spider Silk<br />- (120) motes of life<br />- (40) motes of water<br />- (72) Netherweave cloth<br />- (8) Arcane dust<br /><br />B) Primal Mooncloth Robe (375 tailoring) - (14) PMC (12) Primal Mana (4) Netherweb Spider Silk<br />- (4) Netherweb Spider Silk<br />- (120) Motes of mana<br />- (140) Motes of life<br />- (140) Motes of water<br />- (252) Netherweave cloth<br />- (28) Arcane Dust<br /><br />C) Primal Mooncloth Shoulders (365 tailoring) - (8) PMC (8) Primal Life (2) Netherweb Spider Silk<br />- (2) Nethwerweb Spider Silk<br />- (160) Motes of Life<br />- (80) Motes of water<br />- (16) Arcane Dust<br />- (144) Netherweave cloth<br /><br />Which is a hella lot of motes and cloth... it's also 26 pieces of PMC (but only 13 for a mooncloth tailor) and the cooldown on creating PMC is about 4 days. Which means somewhere between 52 and 104 days to create those three pieces if you don't borrow anyone else's cooldowns.<br /><br />In addition, the set comes with (2) blue and (2) yellow sockets.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Totals for the (3) PMC pieces - this does not take into account the other "primal mooncloth" pieces like the Whitemend pieces. This is just for the belt / shoulders / robe.<br /><br />(8) Netherweb Spider Silk - this silk seems to be running for 4-5g per piece at the AH.<br /><br />(420) Motes of Life (42 Primal Life) - Primal Life runs about 8-10g at the AH<br /><br />(260) Motes of Water (26 Primal Water) - Primal Water runs about 16g at the AH right now<br /><br />(120) Motes of Mana (12 Primal Mana) - Not sure on pricing for this, but figure 15-20g per Primal Mana.<br /><br />(468) Netherweave Cloth - a stack runs about 3.5-4.0g<br /><br />(52) Arcane Dust - which seems to run about 1.5g each<br /><br />Which is something like 1220g worth of materials for the (3) pieces. Fortunately, I'll have no trouble farming the cloth, dust and motes of life with Falrok. And if I ever find the eel pool, I'll have motes of water. The spider silk and motes of mana may be my bottleneck, depending on how fast Snagg and Falrok level up in order to farm them.
