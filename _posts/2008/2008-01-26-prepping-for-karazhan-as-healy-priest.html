So, Corish is L66 and a half, my PMC set is about done (about one more week of farming) and I'm running out of excuses to level up.  But one of the goals of getting to L70 is also that I want to be ready for Karazhan.  (Kara is a 10-man raid dungeon, considered the easiest of the post Burning Crusade dungeons.  Our guild runs it about once a week.)<br /><br />Some of the numbers that I've seen thrown around on the web work out to be:<br /><br />Healing: +1000 (min) up to +1200 or +1400<br />MP5 (while casting): 120 up to 200<br />HP: 7000 hitpoints (buffed)<br />Mana: 9000 mana (buffed) <br /><br />Which probably won't be terribly difficult to attain the lower end of those numbers with just green/blue equipment.  The Primal Mooncloth set is going to go a long way towards shoring me up.  But I still need to put together a wishlist of gear that I want to go hunting for.
