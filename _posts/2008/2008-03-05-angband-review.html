Stumbled across this link while googling for some things about Angband.  It provides a very good introduction into the differences between Angband vs Nethack.  Both games are decended from Rogue (Hack -> Nethack, Moria -> UMoria -> Angband).<br /><br /><a href="http://ninjabattle.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38825&Itemid=26">COLUMN: @Play: Angband - At Last!</a><br /><br />I'm currently playing with Angband 3.0.9 (Vanilla).  The "Vanilla" means that its the original Angband and not one of the few dozen variants.<br /><br />The game play is fairly suitable for all age groups (probably elementary school or middle school aged and onward).<br /><br />(For those that know me personally, I'm very willing to set folks up with a login shell to play Angband, Zork, Nethack, etc.  It works best if each person has their own login.)
