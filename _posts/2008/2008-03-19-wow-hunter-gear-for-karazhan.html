So I'm looking at <a href="http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Moon+Guard&n=Falrok">Falrok's gear</a>, which is going to need to be upgraded a lot before he can go to Karazhan.<br /><br />HP: 7000-8000<br />Mana: 5000-6000<br />AP: 1200-1400 (add 100 for MM builds)<br />Hit Rating: 75-100<br />Crit Rating: 17-20% <br /><br />At level 69, I already have almost the minimum HP for Karazhan (at ~360 STA).  I'll just need to get closer to 400.  Mana is going to be easy because at 140 INT, I'm already at 5000 mana.  AGI helps out with hit, crit and RAP.  So the hard part will be getting enough AGI.  On the other hand, I have hardly any enchants at the moment on my gear.<br /><br /><b>Head Equipment</b><br /><br />[Stalker's Helmet of Second Sight] +60 AP 0 HIT 5 MP5 31 AGI 12 STA 8 INT<br />- (3) blue sockets<br />- Starts with Fantei in Shattrath City, soloable quest chain, probably requires friendly or better with Lower City<br />- Looks like a dragon type skull<br /><br />[Mok'Nathal Beast-Mask] +44 AP 0 HIT 2 MP5 23 AGI 22 STA 12 INT<br />- (2) red (1) yellow sockets<br />- Exarch Maladaar in Auchenai Crypts<br />- Looks like a black haired werewolf mask<br /><br />[Beast Lord Helm] +50 AP 0 HIT 2 MP5 25 AGI 21 STA 22 INT<br />- (1) red (1) meta sockets<br />- part of the <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Beast_Lord_Armor">beast lord armor set</a> and is a rare drop<br />- Pathaleon the Calculator in Mechanar<br /><br />[Earthwarden's Coif] +34 AP 0 HIT 7 MP5 25 AGI 25 STA 18 INT<br />- (1) red (1) meta socket<br />- Quest:The Warlord's Hideout in Steamvaults<br /><br />[Far Seer's Helm] +50 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 0 AGI 37 ATA 25 INT<br />- (1) red (1) blue (1) yellow sockets<br />- Requires Kurenai - Exalted<br />- Only a so-so piece
