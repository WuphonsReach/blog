Trying to fill in a few slots on Falrok... looks like a lot of the slots, I have to fill with drops from Outland dungeon bosses.<br /><br />Note: <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Hit">Hit Rating</a> values above 142 (9%) for a non-survival spec hunter are useless for Burning Crusade raid bosses.  But you'll want a Hit Rating of at least roughly 80 in order to do well in Karazhan.  Survival spec hunters with 3 points in the Surefooted (3/3 or 3%) talent only need 6% or 95 Hit Rating.<br /><br /><b>Feet</b><br /><br />[Boots of the Outlander] 44 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 22 AGI 21 STA 15 INT<br />- Pandemonius in Mana-Tombs<br /><br />[Sky-Hunter Swift Boots] 26 AP 0 HIT 5 MP5 25 AGI 19 STA 24 INT<br />- Darkweaver Syth in Sethekk Halls<br /><br />Alternately, there are some PvP boot options that have reasonable stats.<br /><br /><b>Hands</b><br /><br />[Netherdrake Gloves] 50 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 26 AGI 24 STA 23 INT<br />- Crafted by a leatherworker (BoE recipe)<br />- 4x Heavy Knothide Leather, 24x Nether Dragonscales, 14x Primal Fire, 10x Primal Mana, 1x Primal Nether<br />- The GotRV from the Deathblow to the Legion quest are almost as good<br /><br />[Gauntlets of the Redeemed Vindicator] 48 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 23 AGI 21 STA 20 INT<br />- Deathblow to the Legion (Group) quest for either Aldor or Scryers<br />- Requires friendly(?) faction with Aldor/Scryers to get the quest<br /><br />[Hungarhide Gauntlets] 44 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 27 AGI 21 STA 20 INT<br />- Hungarfen in the Underbog<br /><br />[Beast Lord Handguards] 34 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 25 AGI 12 STA 17 INT<br />- (1) red (1) blue socket +3 Hit Rating bonus<br />- Warchief Kargath Bladefist in Shattered Halls<br /><br />GotRV quest reward are the best of the bunch, with the Beast Lord piece being a decent upgrade due to sockets.<br /><br /><b>Guns</b><br /><br />Falrok must have a boomstick... this is non-negotiable.  Right now, he's using: <br /><br />[Zerid's Vintage Musket] 2.70 sec 54.1 DPS 14 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 8 AGI 12 STA 0 INT<br /><br />There's only 1 dropped gun that is better:<br /><br />[Telescopic Sharprifle] 3.00 sec 66.3 DPS 28 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 13 AGI 0 STA 0 INT<br />- Pathaleon the Calculator in The Mechanar<br /><br />There are (2) crafted guns that are fairly nice:<br /><br />[Ornate Khorium Rifle] 3.10 sec 66.5 DPS 0 AP 13 HIT 0 MPT 14 AGI 0 STA 0 INT<br />- 2x Hardened Adamantite Tube, 12x Khorium Bar, 4x Handful of Fel Iron Bolts, 2x Noble Topaz<br />- Due to the hit rating on this, this is probably a very good gun to have until I can get Exalted with Honor Hold.<br /><br />[Gyro-Balanced Khorium Destroyer] 2.80 sec 75.5 DPS 0 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 0 AGI 30 STA 0 INT<br />- (1) yellow socket<br />- 1x Hardened Adamantite Tube, 20x Khorium Bar, 4x Felsteel Stabilizer, 12x Primal Fire, 12x Primal Air, 1x Primal Nether<br />- This is more of a "tanky" gun then a "hunter" weapon.<br /><br />A quest reward weapon:<br /><br />[Bloodwarder's Rifle] 2.60 sec 62.9 DPS 30 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 8 AGI 7 STA 0 INT<br />- Akama's Promise in Shadowmoon Valley (group quest)<br /><br />And lastly, a few reputation reward guns:<br /><br />[Veteran's Musket] 2.70 sec 73.7 DPS 22 AP 11 HIT 0 MP5 12 AGI 0 STA 0 INT<br />- Honor Hold - Exalted<br /><br />[Consortium Blaster] 2.40 sec 66.2 DPS 28 AP 0 HIT 0 MP5 0 AGI 15 STA 0 INT<br />- The Consortium - Revered
