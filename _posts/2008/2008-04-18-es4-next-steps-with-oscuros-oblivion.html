This is a follow-up post for <a href="/blog/2008/08/getting-started-with-oscuros-oblivion.shtml">Getting started with Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul</a>.  After all, once you've done the things in that post, what next?<br /><br />1) If you have Shivering Isles - go ahead and start the main quest.  You'll obtain <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Shivering:Baiting_the_Trap">Dawnfang/Duskfang</a>, which is a good low-level 1H sword that will work for you until you can get into the mage's guild to enchant one of your own.  At lower levels, it only weighs 19-23 lbs, so it's reasonable to carry for something that will never run out of charges (it refreshes twice per day).  The higher level versions are a lot heavier.<br /> <br />2)  Your 2nd goal is to get the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Shivering:Ruin%27s_Edge">Ruin's Edge</a> bow.  This is an outstanding bow for a young character who likes to sneak around and open combat with a ranged attack.  Your enemies will often attack their cohorts (Frenzy effect), or they'll be stuck standing in place (Burden), or they'll fall down (Paralyze), or simply run away (Demoralize).  The bow is not leveled, so you'll want to obtain it sooner rather then later.<br /><br />3) Your 3rd goal in Shivering Isles should be to obtain lots and lots of potion making ingredients.  Especially Black Tar from the Dementia side of the isles.<br /><br />4) You can do some of the Mage's Guild recommendation quests prior to level 10.  Specifically Skingrad, Chorrol, Cheydinhal, Bravil and Bruma.  The Leyawin quest will be difficult at level 12 (drink health potions early and use poisons freely).  The Anvil quest tends to be another difficult one as well with a high-level opponent (but you do have allies in that quest).  In order to get the Bravil recommendation quest, you may have to do the nightmare quest first where you fight two minotaurs.  You'll probably have to turn the difficulty slider down a bit in order to pull it off.<br /><br />5) Some of the fighter's guild quests are reported to be easy at the start.  Later ones are much more difficult.<br /><br />6) Start collecting souls (Lesser / Common / Greater).  This will allow you (once you gain access to the Arcane University) the ability to create magical equipment.<br /><br />7) Train your armorer skill.  One way is to create a self-only "damage armor" spell in the Arcane University.  Then you put on an old suit of junk armor and cast it on yourself.  When the armor breaks, you repair it.  The other way is to use armor damaging spells on your opponents, then loot and repair their armor.  Once you get to level 50 in Armorer, you'll be able to repair magic gear.<br /><br />8) One poster suggested <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Fort_Ash">Fort Ash</a>, <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Fort_Virtue">Fort Virtue</a> or <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Fanacasecul">Fanacasecul</a>.  The goblin mine east of Skingrad along the road is rumored to be a good low-level dungeon as well.<br /><br />9) One random note - having Mysticism as a starting skill is not a good idea if you use Gather Ye Rosebuds.<br /><br />10) Another suggests starting with dungeons: Fort Urasek, Fort Ash, Fort Virtue, or Fanacasecul, Fatback Cave, Dzonot Cave (has amazons - so I disagree that you should go there much before L25), <br /><br />11) Find the Winged Bow.<br /><br />12) Loot the clams in the waters around the Imperial City.  (Personally, I save the drops from those clams for use with Geomancy.)<br /><br />13) Work on getting your security skill up to 60+ in order to pick the hardest chests (41+ for Hard Locks).  Alternately, train up Alteration to 75 to cast the "open hard lock" skill and 100 for the "very hard" lock spell.<br /><br />14) Buy at least (1) spell of every type so that you can create enchants with it later.  Key spells are touch spells that do fire / frost / shock damage.  Don't forget telekenisis, heal self, heal other, or resist / shield spells.<br /><br />15) Beginner dungeons are scattered near Imperial City, with the ones on the west side of the city/lake probably easier then the ones on the east side.  (The one exception that I know of is southwest of Chestnut Handy Stables - it contains amazons.)
