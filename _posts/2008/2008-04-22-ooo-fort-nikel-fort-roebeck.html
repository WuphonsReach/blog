Still working my way through the dungeons surrounding the Imperial City.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Fort_Nikel">Fort Nikel</a> - This is somewhat of a pushover at level 17 with good potions and a moderately enchanted bow.  The bandits and the marauders still mostly slaughter each other off in the last section, but you'll still end up with 3-4 left overs that you'll have to snipe from above.  So bring lots of poisons and arrows.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Fort_Roebeck">Fort Roebeck</a> - This was a good bit more difficult at level 17.  I packed along 100 silencing poisons, 150 arrows, health potions and there were still some rough spots.  With OOO, you're going to find low-mid level daedra outside, along with conjurers.  Inside, you'll likely find Frost Atronachs, Flame Antronachs, various types of metallic golems, conjurers, and at least 1 plane summoner.  Fortunately, you can snipe most of the conjurers from walkways above their areas.  The best loot that I got out of here (in addition to 3-4 enchanted pieces of clothing for selling) was a journeyman level piece of alchemy equipment.<br /><br />I also want to take a look at Fort Black Boot, Sage Glen Hollow and any other goblin / bandit dungeons around the Imperial City.  Basically working my way around the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Red_Ring_Road">Red Ring Road</a> as a starting point.<br /><br />By running the two dungeons, I earned enough gold (and gathered a few more greater souls) to enchant a new pair of weapons.  One is a Fine Steel Bow that I've enchanted to do +8 damage with fire / frost / shock (compared to +5 with the old bow).  And I enchanted a shortsword with +11 damage for each of the three damage types.  Both weapons also inflict a light spell on the opponent (magnitude 10 for about 20-30 seconds), which makes it easier to see my opponents after I hit them.<br /><br />The most useful piece of dungeon gear that I have at the moment is a simple enchanted headpiece with Detect Life on it.  Its range is 115 ft, which is quite good and a lot more then I can create at the enchanting altar.   Since it is additive, I may equip a 2nd piece for more range (150-200 ft is what I prefer).  It's extremely handy to have a permanent item with that enchant because I get tired of casting it all the time in dungeons.
