(never finished)<br /><br />Ammo counts are listed as (# of rounds in the clip / maximum rounds carried).  The maximum rounds carried includes whatever ammo has been loaded into the weapon.<br /><br /><b>AT-14 Pistol</b> (18 or 36 / 200)<br />Your basic pistol that holds 18 rounds in the clip.  You'll start with this as your only weapon during Interval 01 - Point of Origin.  Later on, after you find a 2nd AT-14 (during Interval 02), it can be dual-wielded, giving you 36 rounds before you need to reload.  <br /><br />Verdict: Very effective when used in slow-motion, and you can take down most light infantry with upper-torso / head shots.  The accuracy is fairly good at ranges of 20-40m.  But you'll still want to trade up to a better weapon when you can during Interval 03.<br /><br /><b>RPL Sub-Machinegun</b> (50 / 500)<br />At the start of Interval 02 - First Encounter, you will receive this weapon before dropping out of the helocopter (with 2 spare clips of ammo for a total of 150 rounds).  This is a great little weapon with lots of ammo laying in early intervals.  It doesn't have a lot of stopping power, so you'll need to air carefully for the upper torso and try to walk your rounds up into a head shot for a quick kill.   The high rate of fire means that you'll expend ammo very fast, so use a light touch on the trigger.<br /><br />Verdict: Eventually, you'll want to trade up to a more powerful or specialized weapon.  In my opinion, you should probably trade up after the hot and heavy LZ fight at the start of Interval 04.<br /><br /><b>G2A2 Assault Rifle</b> (45 / 450)<br />This is an important weapon that you'll pickup in the second or third Blacksand Imports Pacific Rim building in Interval 02 - First Encounter in an upstairs office with a dead guard along with two more frag grenades, body armor, a health kit and a pistol.  You'll only have 2 clips of 45 rounds at the start, so I suggest sticking with your RPL SMG as your primary weapon until late in that interval.  Or even waiting until partway through Interval 03 to start using it more heavily.  Accuracy at moderate range is a lot better then the RPL SMG with less muzzle climb if you fire in small bursts.<br /><br />Verdict: This is THE weapon to have from Interval 03 onward.  With a hefty reserve round capacity, you can deal with large quantities of opponents.  It does a good amount of damage against more heavily armored opponents.  But like the RPL SMG, you can burn through a lot of ammo if you do not shoot accurately.  Starting in Interval 03/04 onward, you should easily find ammo for the G2A2.<br /> <br /><b>VK-12 Combat Shotgun</b> ( / )<br />This weapon first shows up towards the start of Interval 03 (??).  It is extremely deadly against light/medium infantry at close range (3-4m), but near useless past 5-10m due to the spread of the shot.  It does pack quite a punch.<br /><br />Verdict: Some people are a big fan of the shotgun, I'm not so sure.  I prefer to keep as much range as possible between myself and the opponent.  It's a toss-up whether you should carry this or the RPL SMG, or even the ASP Rifle.<br /><br /><b>ASP Rifle</b> (30 / <br />You'll get a chance to pick this up about 1/3 through Interval 03 - Escalation (Exeunt Omnes).  It lays up against a wall near a Health Booster.  You'll find a 2nd one later on during the same interval.<br /><br /><b>10mm HV Penetrator</b> (25 / 250)<br />First seen towards the end of Interval 03 - Escalation (Heavy Resistance).  As seen from the in-game reticle, it is an extremely accurate weapon with very little kick.  But ammo is not very plentiful, so save this weapon for use against heavily armored enemies or as a sniper rifle.  <br /><br />Verdict: Packs a hell of a punch, careful shooting with the 10mm HV will put down a Heavy Infantry soldier or take out an automated turret in 15-20 shots.  <br /><br /><b>Type-7 Particle Weapon</b><br /><br />Verdict: Lots of flash, but the lack of ammo makes it a tough sell until later levels.  Pick it up when you need a sniper style weapon that will put your opponents down in a single shot.<br /><br /><b>MOD-3 Multi-Rocket Launcher</b><br /><br />Verdict: Pick it up when you find it, use it on the heavy enemy of the moment, then toss it away.<br /><br /><b>MP-50 Repeating Cannon</b><br /><br /><b>N6A3 Fragmentation Grenade</b> (1 / 5)<br />As you make your way through the second Blacksand Imports Pacific Rim building in Interval 02 - First Encounter, you will find a pair of N6A3s sitting on an office desk.  These smart grenades can be used as a traditional timed-delay grenade, or they will explode instantly on contact with an enemy soldier.  They are deadly against light infantry at a range of out to about 2-3m from the point of explosion, but you will use them mostly to flush the enemy out of hiding spots.  <br /><br />Verdict: Don't expect to get many direct kills with these, but they are extremely useful when up against multiple infantry.  They are moderately common through the various intervals, but you'll want to use them sparingly.  It will be rare that you have a full set of 5 grenades.
