Got a big piece of good news this afternoon.  When the vets operated on Lucille, they found it that the lump was nothing more then a bit of fat protruding through a hernia in the abdominal wall.  Apparently, whoever did the spaying operation last October, did not close it up correctly.<br /><br />So, no cancern, no lumps, just an easily fixable issue that required a few stitches.  It was important that it be fixed, because it could have gotten worse.<br /><br />Of course, all this means a kitty with a shaved belly and the joy of wearing an elizabethan collar for most of the week.  She's still getting used to that collar, but we're getting there.  I fed her a bit of dinner earlier (sweetened with a bit of dried fish flakes) and she's spent about two hours in my lap so far, sleeping.<br /><br />I'll have to give her a bit of a scrubdown with a washcloth and towel twice a day, because she can't bathe herself at the moment.  She was well-behaved at the vet, letting them carry her around.  She was completely wide-eyed, but mostly calm.  Suffering through it all without complaint.<br /><br />They even managed to trim all of her claws before they took her in for her operation (and she put up with it).  So I guess I'll have to try my luck.  I've been massaging her front paws for a few months now, and she's been letting me hold them longer and longer, but I didn't press the issue long enough to trim them.<br /><br />Fortunately, I spent most of the day in the office, so I should be good to work from home the rest of the week.
