I'm having a real difficult time getting into Morrowind.  Even with a small selection of add-ons, the world feels empty and interfacing with it is painful.  Oblivion just has a much more polished feel to the user interface and controls.<br /><br />But I'm only up to level 2 and still finding my way around Seyda Need (the starting area) and Balmora (a nearby city).
