Picked this up on a lark, and mostly wish I hadn't.<br /><br />The story could be good, but the pacing is horrid and the main protagonist is simply over the edge for 90% of the time.  The only interesting character in the whole thing is the hitman hired from Chicago.  And you'll only spend about 20 or 30 pages with him towards the end of the book.<br /><br />You'll spend a lot of time page-flipping, waiting for the action to start or for motivations to make sense.<br /><br />I felt like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a heroic epic, a horror book, a mystery, or a thriller.  The ending was very much a muddle, with no resolution and simplistic tying up of plotlines.  Ultimately, the actions of the protagonist had no effect.<br /><br />Which maybe was the point of the book.  In which case it comes across as nothing more then anti-industry propoganda rather then an entertaining read.
