With the -80% (5x slower) ESP chosen, you'll worry a lot less about your weapon condition or armor condition.  I just wish there was a -67% choice.  The -50% didn't feel like enough, and the -80% almost feels too easy.  But I may change my mind after another week or two.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6395">BM08 Random Bobbleheads</a>: Moves the bobbleheads around randomly.  They get placed in 20 out of 100 new locations across the wastelands.  (Each bobblehead can appear in 1 of 5 locations.)  Hopefully, this will make it more worthwhile to explore everywhere...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=40">No Bad Karma Noise</a>: This is a quality of life mod for when you decide to start stealing and killing.  Turns off the noise associated with karma loss.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=230">Reduced karma loss for stealing</a>: Now you only lose 1 point per theft instead of 5 points.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=839">Karma Revamp Mod</a>: I looked at a few and settled on this one.  It doesn't play with the levels for Very Good / Good / Neutral / Evil / Very Evil - as changing those values tends to break GNR announcements and other things.  I settled on "Karma Hard" (makes it harder to earn good karma) along with a few other optional ESPs.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=7759">Regulating Karma Talon Style</a>: I'm going to install this one soon.  It makes it so that Regulators and Talon Company only chases you when you have Very Good or Very Evil karma (not just Good or Evil).<br /><br />...<br /><br />Started a new game tonight.  Going to go with more of a stealth character, but much more chaotic neutral.  She'll kill you if she thinks it will benefit her...  Leaving XP at 100% for the first 5 or so levels, then I'll knock it back to 50%.<br /><br />FOOK2 is almost released, and FOOK2 v1.1 is already under development... so I'll probably try that next.
