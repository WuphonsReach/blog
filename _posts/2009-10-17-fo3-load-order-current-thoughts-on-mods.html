MMM, with Increased Spawns (more critters!), Hunting & Looting, Tougher Traders, Zones Respawn and Natural Selection -- MMM simply makes the wastes more interesting as critters will fight other critters and not just the player. One side effect of Increased Spawns is that any feral ghoul whose head is not blown off, has a hefty chance of coming back to life within a few minutes and coming back for seconds. So either you kill all ghouls by blowing heads off, or else you do the job after they're dead, or you risk them haunting you.<br /><br />Darker Interiors / Xepha's Darker Nights - lowers the brightness level just a bit indoors and outside. Darker Interiors is very subtle, while Xepha's is more dramatic. Xepha's will require that you either do your ops only during daytime, or else that you get a NVG addon or some sort of flashlight. With DI installed, there are times that you *have* to use your PipBoy light or NVGs to look for loot in underground / interior locations.<br /><br />Longer Days & Longer Nights - if you're gonna make the night darker, may as well make it last longer. There are a few versions of this mod, this one simply increases the time length of day/night cycle by 2x. So that it takes 48 min to cycle through a day instead of 24 min. So if you start your op at dawn/dusk, you have about 20 minutes of day or night to get things done.<br /><br />Vanishing Piles - makes ash/goo piles go away. More of a fix then a game changer. Not sure whether EVE has this functionality or not.<br /><br />Choose_XP - Allows you to change the rate of XP gain from like 0% to 200%. I generally leave it at 100% until level 3 or 4, then cut back to 50%. Works with Broken Steel. (Arwen also has an XP tweaker that is actively developed. Instead of a flat XP rate change, Arwen did a lot more tweaking.) I found that 33% was too slow, but it's every easy to equip the Choose_XP doodad and change your rate.<br /><br />Maintenance Shed - Very basic player owned house in Springvale. Good for characters who don't do Power of the Atom right away.<br /><br />DC Interiors - High quality mod that adds locations in Mason District, Georgetown and Seward Square.<br /><br />Ammo Dispenser - Adds an ammo terminal inside the Citadel where you can buy ammo. So if you have lots of caps, have gained entry to the Citadel, you can buy as much ammo as you have caps for. I just wish that the ammo cost was about 2x or 3x higher... (I might take this back out of future plays, haven't decided yet).<br /><br />Nightvision Goggles (Powered) - Adds NVGs that use Energy Cells. I generally set it to use 1 cell every 10 seconds. Works hand-in-glove with Xepha's and Darker Interiors and does a good job of simulating the motion blur of NVGs. It can drop your framerate at times.<br /><br />Slower Degradation - Cuts the rate of weapon degradation. I run at -50% of normal. Which is slow enough that your weapons don't break after every battle, but fast enough that you still have to worry about weapon repairs. I tried -80% and it was too easy to ignore weapon health. With MMM + Increased Spawns, -50% or, if it existed, -67% would be about right. Go with -80% if you're a rock-and-roll type that sends large volumes of fire downrange, or -50% for a more tactical play.<br /><br />Reduced Karma for Stealing - Steal more stuff with less karma loss (I think 1 point loss instead of 5 points).<br /><br />Karma Hard with Future Imperfect, Cannibal Increase and Church Decrease - Makes it harder to gain / lose karma. A lot harder. Instead of immediately being "Very Good" after leaving Vault 101, my character stayed in Neutral territory for a long time and had to work on it to get into Good. It does not play with the "level ranges" of karma, so is very compatible with things and works well.<br /><br />Real Physics (with Car Explosions) - Tones down the amount of crazy when a NPC gets shot. I'm on the fence with leaving this one in or out as I'm not 100% convinced that it plays well with MMM (but I don't know FO3Edit well enough to tell).<br /><br />BM08 Random Bobbleheads - This is probably the big kahuna in my current game. It takes all of the bobbleheads and moves them to new locations. Each bobblehead can appear in 1 of 5 new locations. So, even if you know where all the locations are, it's still a 20% chance that you'll find what you're looking for. I'm very very tempted to do the same thing for skill books... it's also something that I wish FWE / FOOK2 would add to their overhauls. If you find that knowing where those bobbleheads are is boring and you're constantly chasing them in a set order at the start of each game, then this is the solution.<br /><br />3EF Helmless - Changes the Chinese Stealth Suit into a 2-pc armor set (helm and armor). So now you can wear just the lower portion, without a helmet. Also seems to fix the glitch where you can wear unlimited # of hats with the CSS.<br /><br />BD66 Merged Camo Combat Armor - Places 3 versions of Combat Armor (equivalent to Reilly's Ranger armor) in Bethesda. There's a light grey camo version, a dark grey camo, and a yellow/green camo version. I use the non-replacer version of the mod. Sometimes I'll fight my way to the armor crate, other times I'll only reward myself once I've completed the Reilly's Rangers quest.<br /><br />Texture/Sound replacers:<br /><br />Color Hi-Detailed map and icons - Gives your pipboy a high-res detailed map of the Capitol Wastelands instead of the default monochrome map. The downside is that the CW will suddenly appear a lot smaller if you zoom in close and start tracing out roads. The upside is that it's easier to see cliffs / roads / buildings and really get a feel for where you are.<br /><br />Alternate Female Face, Assaukt Rifles Retextured, Better Litter, Enhanced Night Sky, Green Green Grass of Home, Hi-Res Lunchbox, krzymar Hi-Res Moon Dark, Hi-Res Skill Boooks, Sandbag Retexture, Sparking Eyes (Default Eyes Only), WJS DLC05 Retex -- All are basic retextures of regular textures that make things look nicer without imposing huge frame rate issues. Green Green Grass adds a subtle bit of color to the wastes.<br /><br />MP No Bad Karma Noise - Changes the karma loss noise to a silent audio effect. Which is very nice for evil characters who get tired of hearing that constant whine.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Fallout3.esm<br />Anchorage.esm<br />ThePitt.esm<br />BrokenSteel.esm<br />PointLookout.esm<br />Zeta.esm<br />Mart's Mutant Mod.esm<br />GalaxyNewsRadio100[M].esp<br />DCInteriors_Georgtown.esp<br />DCInteriors_Mason.esp<br />DCInteriors_SewardSq.esp<br />MaintenanceShed.esp<br />Ammo_Dispenser v 2.esp<br />3EFhelmlessstealthsuit.esp<br />BD Merged Camo Battlearmor.esp<br />sunglassescollection.esp<br />NightvisionGoggles(Powered).esp<br />RealPhysicsWithCarExplosions.esp<br />Slower Degradation (-50%).esp<br />KarmaFutureImperfect1010.esp<br />KarmaCannibalIncrease1010.esp<br />KarmaChurchDecrease1010.esp<br />KarmaHard1010.esp<br />reduced karma loss for Stealing.esp<br />choose_XP.esp<br />VanishingPiles.esp<br />BM08RandomBobbleheadsFixed.esp<br />Longer Days & Longer Nights.esp<br />Xepha's Darker Nights.esp<br />DarkerInteriorsFallOut3.esp<br />DarkerInteriorsBrokenSteel.esp<br />DarkerInteriorsAnchorage.esp<br />DarkerInteriorsPointLookout.esp<br />DarkerInteriorsZeta.esp<br />DarkerInteriorsThePitt.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - Increased Spawns.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - Hunting & Looting.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - Tougher Traders.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - Zones Respawn.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - Natural Selection.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - DLC Anchorage.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - DLC Broken Steel.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - DLC The Pitt.esp<br />Mart's Mutant Mod - DLC Point Lookout.esp<br /><br />Total active plugins: 45<br />Total plugins: 48
