Right now, I'm playing a red-headed female stealthy/sniper style character and enjoying it immensely.  She's a bit of a goody-goody, with exceptionally high karma, who rarely takes payment for services.  No stealing, no unprovoked killing, no killing of neutral/good NPCs.  <br /><br />However, there are a few other general concepts that I want to explore:<br /><br />1) Female, taking the Child at Heart perk, possibly more of a thieving sort with a knowledge of explosives.  With the attributes at STR 2, PER 7, END 2, CHA 7, INT 6, AGI 8, LUCK 8, this gal is going to be a wee slip of a lass who needs to be smart and lucky to stay alive.<br /><br />2) Male or female, walking tank in power armor.  Possibly using energy weapons, but definitely more of a big guns style of heavy combat.  STR 8, PER 3, END 8, CHA 3, INT 5, AGI 7, LUCK 6.  Fighting for the Brotherhood of Steel is pretty much a guaranteed fit.  Megaton might not fare too well, or I might strive to stay somewhat neutral.<br /><br />3) Evil Female, maybe male.  Probably a sniper playstyle similar to what I'm playing now, but also a thief and murderer who lies, cheats and takes the low road.  Megaton will not be left standing.
