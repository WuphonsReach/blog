Here's a short snippet (5 minutes) of my first encounter with a Super Mutant... and his big brother who showed up during the fight.<br /><br />Warning: This gets a bit violent and gory at the end.<br /><br /><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2CFESkhC7Kg&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2CFESkhC7Kg&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br />So many bad tactical decisions:<br /><br />- At the time, while I had a .308 sniper rifle in my inventory, ammo was scarce so I decided against using it for the opening shot.<br /><br />- I had not learned yet that you could hold down the [Left-Mouse] button to fire the Chinese Assault Rifle in continuous fire mode.<br /><br />- Nor did I understand the use of Stimpaks (but figured that out quickly enough).  It might have been smart to pop some chems.<br /><br />- Never use cars, motorcycles, or other vehicles as cover.  Then tend to be highly flammable and explosive.<br /><br />- When being shot at by missles, don't stand with your back to an embankment, where the missles that miss you can hit and do splash damage.<br /><br />- My initial stalk and scouting of the location was flawed.  I should have swept left to the high ground so that I could look into the large tractor trailer.<br /><br />- Retreating while laying down frag mines might have been a good idea.<br /><br />(This is also my first use of YouTube.  Which was fairly easy.  The video was recorded at 1600x900 in FRAPS, then downsized to a 2.8Mbps 2-pass XVid 720p with 192Mbps MP3 CBR stereo audio track.  YouTube accepted that upload without a hitch and the transcoding done on the YouTube servers took 30-60 minutes.  I debated adding annotations, but preferred to leave the video "as-is".)
