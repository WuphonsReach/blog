Fallout 3 turns out to be very engrossing.  While it comes from the same folks that made Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, they didn't make the mistake again of making *everything* leveled with the player.  Instead, they sort of gated things, so that Super Mutant Masters and Overlords don't show up until you're of higher level.  That makes the world feel a bit more natural and scary as you level up.<br /><br />I went ahead and bought the (5) expansion packs and installed them.  So far, I'm running a very stock game other then the "DC Interiors" project which adds indoor locations to 3 spots in DC.  (Which I have yet to visit...)<br /><br />Astike (who is now level 29) has turned into a commando type of gal.  Adept with the sniper rifle and 1H/2H projectile weapons.  But, she still turns her nose up at heavy weapons and energy weapons.  For her armor, she's generally clad in Combat Armor, which is a step up from leather/recon armor, but nowhere near as heavy as Power Armor (a.k.a. walking tin can).  Her opening move typically involves stealth attacks from a hidden position (Sniper Rifle, Chinese Assault Rifle, or close-quarters weapons like the Combat Shotgun or 10mm SMG).  In a heavy firefight with room to move, she uses the Chinese Assault Rifle or 10mm SMG for pure volume of steel on target.<br /><br />By far, her favorite missions are infiltration types where you sneak into the target without companions, commit mayhem, then escape into the night.  But there had better be a good reason for the mayhem, or some furtherance of public good.  She's still a goody-goody, and doesn't care if the miscreant is ghoul, human or mutant.<br /><br />(My next character, OTOH, is going to be more neutral/evil and a lot more chaotic.)<br /><br />Expansion thoughts...<br /><br /><b>Pitt:</b> This is one that you'll want to start somewhere around level 8-12.  Whenever you feel comfortable enough with your primary weapon skill that you can take on multiple targets.  You'll also want a decent (30-50) explosives skill to survive crossing the first bridge.  I saved this until the mid-20s, and the reward weapon (Perforator / Infiltrator) is a light-duty 5.56mm weapon.  It doesn't pack a punch like the 5.56mm Chinese Assault Rifle does, but it comes with a silencer and scope.  A weapon that definitely works well up until level 20 or so, after that it's very weak.  Very linear expansion, but access to the "Ammo Press" after you complete the quest chain is worthwhile.  Travel light on your way to Pitt as you'll be fully overloaded when you come back (and you'll probably make multiple trips).<br /><br /><b>Operation Anchorage:</b> Commando / stealth mission with excellent loot at the end from the armory.  I did it in the late-teens, but also would make this more of a priority for a stealth-oriented character.  Travel light on your way to do this content.<br /><br /><b>Point Lookout:</b> This is nasty and brutal at times.  Make sure you arrive with plenty of anti-radiation medication along with Stimpaks.  I don't know if this content is really doable prior to 20, although I might try.<br /><br /><b>Mothership Zeta:</b> I'll admin, I have done nothing more then peek at the content, then reloaded to a prior save because I wasn't ready for it.  It's another one of those "strip your gear, give it back at the end" expansions (just like Pitt/Anchorage).  Folks who prefer energy weapons will want to do this expansion early (levesl 10-15 or so?).<br /><br /><b>Broken Steel:</b> This is the mother of all expansions.  It doesn't really add new areas, but raises the level cap to 30 and integrates with the primary plotline in Fallout 3.  If you're a fan of the Brotherhood of Steel, then this quest chain will make you happy.  There are some truly epic moments in the Death from Above quest.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Right now, I plan on retiring Astike once I finish up the last mission in Broken Steel and get her to level 30.  At that point, I plan on rerolling in some fashion and working on the content again from a different point of view.<br /><br />Although she's a heck of a lot of fun...
