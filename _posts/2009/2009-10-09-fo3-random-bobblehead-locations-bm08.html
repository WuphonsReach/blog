This is a cheat-sheet for the <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6395">BM08 Random Bobbleheads</a> mod for Fallout 3.  The BM08 mod moves the location of all of the 20 bobbleheads in the game to new locations.  Each bobblehead can appear in 1 of 5 locations.  I'm going to try and be somewhat vague in the possible locations.<br /><br />The author's quote from the README file provides general guideance:<br /><br /><i>No, I stuck with tradition and placed every Bobblehead in a building, avoided wide open spaces, subway areas, huge piles of rubble, and inaccessible areas as much as possible. Most are in a room of some sort, many are on tables, on shelves, while only a few are on the ground, or in caves. Some may be in the same building as an original but never the same place and never the same Bobblehead type.</i><br /><br /><b>S.P.E.C.I.A.L.

Each bobblehead has 5 possible locations (randomized when you start a new game).<br /><br />- All of the ones that I've found so far have been inside / underground, unless noted.<br /><br />- A lot of these locations were mined from the ESP using FO3Edit.  I did not check the randomization script to also see whether the bobbleheads were actually activated.<br /><br />- Locations named as towns (such as Canterbury Commons include locations within shooting distance of the town area).<br /><br />- Signal Station refers to the locations that can be discovered by tracking in on the Ham Radio morse code signals.<br /><br />Some of these locations are easier to be vague about then others.  Such as saying that I found the Charisma one in Dupont Circle.  There are numerous locations in Dupont Circle where you can look, so it's a good hint.  For the ones that appear in MDPL Power Stations or VAPL Sites, I've decided not to be specific about which one they're found at because there are only about a dozen sites (noted as "Power Site").
