Example of Fallout 3 game-play at Bailey's Crossroads in the Operation: Anchorage DLC. The Brotherhood Outcasts are battling against Super Mutants on their way to the Outcast Outpost. You can either hang back or attempt to help the Outcasts make their way through the ruined building. This is pretty much vanilla Fallout 3 without mods, using the regular Recon Armor and the Chinese Assault Rifle along with the Shady Hat. <br /><br /><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8xsbtqhce6o&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8xsbtqhce6o&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br />It's a good example of what firefights end up looking and feeling like in Fallout 3.  Especially when there are NPCs helping you out with the nasties.  Of course, the NPCs constantly get in your way, so you can't just rock and roll with your fully automatic weapon.<br /><br />Apologies for the blurriness, apparently after I recorded this I only saved it in a 2Mbps XVid file instead of my usual 2.8Mbps XVid.  Things tend to stay really crisp at 2.8Mbps XVid for 720p footage, but get blurry below 2.5Mbps (at least for this type of footage).  Toss in the re-encoding that YouTube does and you end up with a bit of a muddle.
