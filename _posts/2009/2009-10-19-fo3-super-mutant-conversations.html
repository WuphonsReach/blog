Random conversation overheard in Fallout 3.<br /><br />Mutant 1: I was thinking. And it hurt! Hurt my head! But I remembered things. From before... I think I knew a woman. Or maybe, I WAS a woman... Aggh! It hurts!<br /><br />Mutant 2: Ha! You talk a lot! Sound funny when you talk, like a stupid human! Ha ha ha ha ha!<br /><br />Mutant 1: Ah, I'm done talkin' to you anyway.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Mutant 1: What do you want?<br /><br />Mutant 2: Wish I had a new weapon.  Something good to smash with.  Wish I could hold one of those Behemoth clubs.  So big! So much crush!<br /><br />Mutant 1: Umm... Well... Ahhh... Sure...<br /><br />Mutant 2: Ah, I'm done talkin' to you anyway.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Mutant 1: I need a new gun.  I want something that won't break.  Something that will shoot forever.  One of us had... a Fat Man!  I want one of those...<br /><br />Mutant 2: I don't know! What do I look like, a human?  Talk, talk, talk, that's all you ever do!<br /><br />Mutant 1: Bah! I'm gonna go back to doin'... what I was doin'...
