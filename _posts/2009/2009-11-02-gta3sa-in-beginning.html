This is the introductory clip that plays when you start a new game.  It explains a bit about CJ's background and has a bit of foreshadowing.  (The issue with the police car shuddering is a limitation of the GTA3 game engine on the PC when the camera is moving and also tracking a moving object.)<br /><br /><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XJE1MrK4a9c&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XJE1MrK4a9c&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br />GTA3:SA came out back in Oct 2004, so the game is already 5 years old.  Which is why the characters look blocky (especially when compared to modern games).  On the upside, it runs extremely well on my system and I can turn up the draw distance all the way.  So, as long as you're not turned off by the gameplay elements (violence, gangs, hookers, murder, sex, drinking, drugs), it works well on not-so-new hardware.<br /><br />The source for this was FRAPS at 1600x900, ~30 FPS, progressive encoding (RGB).  Converted using StaxRip to 720p (1280x720) using x264 (approximately 3800Kbps) with AAC stereo audio.  This was more of a test to see whether YouTube liked the mp4 file format and the encoding settings.
