If you thought Zero's "Supply Lines..." mission was hard, wait until you get a load of "New World Army" where you only have 8 minutes to tackle the objective.  Personally, on the PC, I found this mission to be so frustrating that I delved into editing the main.scm file to change the timer from 8 minutes to 15 minutes.<br /><br />Things that you need to know:<br /><ul><br /><li>Changing the main.scm file (under data/scripts in the install folder) is dangerous and could corrupt your save files.  Make backups of the main.scm, script.img and save game files prior to starting.<br /><li>This is for GTA:SA second edition (v2.00 or special edition) for the PC.<br /><li>Time is stored in milliseconds in the decompiled source code for the SCM file, so we're looking for a value of 8*60*1000 (480000).  In hex, this is 0x0075300.<br /><li>Byte order seems to be reversed in the compiled SCM file, so we're looking for "00 53 07 00".<br /><li>This only appears in 2 places in the entire main.scm file.  The key is that the identifier Z4_M11 appears near one of the two occurences.<br /></ul><br /><br /><pre><br />001ce4e0h: 02 FD 06 03 44 00 06 00 00 00 3F 06 00 03 6E 00 ; .ý..D.....?...n.<br />001ce4f0h: 04 00 06 00 03 6F 00 04 03 06 00 03 7F 00 04 03 ; .....o.........<br />001ce500h: 04 00 02 20 74 01 00 53 07 00 C3 03 02 20 74 04 ; ... t..S..Ã.. t.<br />001ce510h: 01 09 5A 34 5F 4D 31 31 00 00 F7 04 02 24 74 04 ; ..Z4_M11..÷..$t.<br />001ce520h: 01 04 01 09 5A 34 5F 4D 30 36 00 00 06 00 03 41 ; ....Z4_M06.....A<br /></pre><br /><br />The source code for this section when decompiled looks like:<br /><br /><code><br />:ZERO4_9417<br />110@ = 0 <br />111@ = 3 <br />127@ = 3 <br />$ZERO4_TIME = 900000 <br />03C3: set_timer_to $ZERO4_TIME type 1 GXT 'Z4_M11' // global_variable  // Timer<br />04F7: status_text $ZERO4_CAR_HEALTH type 1 line 1 GXT 'Z4_M06' // global_variable  // Bandit<br />65@ = -1000 <br />64@ = 10000 <br />35@ += 1 <br /></code><br /><br />Notice the "Z4_M11" and "Z4_M06" strings, which gives us a good idea that we've found the right hex code to edit.<br /><br />We're going to change "00 53 07 00" (480,000 milliseconds or 0x0075300) to "A0 BB 0D 00" (900,000 milliseconds or 0x000DBBA0).  I used UltraEdit-32 to make my changes, but you could use other hex editors.<br /><br />Once changed, load up your save game and start the New Model Army mission, you'll see that the timer now starts at 15 minutes instead of 8 minutes.  The other way to check is to use "Sanny Builder 3" and decompile the new main.scm file to double-check that you changed ZERO4_TIME correctly.
