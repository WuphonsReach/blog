Swapping out the physics mod that I use.  For a long time, I've been using <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=311">Real Physics</a>, which is supposed to decrease the issue where enemies go flying when you hit them with bullets.  However, I've been plagued with lots of small issues when using this in conjunction with MMM (Mart's Mutant Mod).  When I shoot things like ants, which have slightly different sizes due to MMM, their limbs often vanish or start flailing around wildly due to getting stuck in the terrain.  And in the worst case, you can end up with a ball of madly gyrating yarn a meter or few across that can cause a game crash.<br /><br />So now I'm trying <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=12306">Realistic Death Physics</a>, which is a more tamped down version by a different mod author.  Initial results in Greyditch with all the ants looks good, but I'll wait to see how things go down in Marigold Station with the rest of the ant horde.<br /><br />Here's an example from Greyditch of issues with the older "Real Physics" mod:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZlsomugJclg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZlsomugJclg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
