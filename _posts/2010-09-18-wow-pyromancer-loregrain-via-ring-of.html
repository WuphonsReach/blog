Shows how to do somewhat of a speed run from the entrance to Blackrock Depths (BRD) to Pyromancer Loregrain who drops Formula: Enchant Weapon - Fiery Weapon (an enchant with about a 13% drop rate). This is the route to take if you don't have the Shadowforge Key yet.<br /><br />The route is basically:<ul><li>Enter instance, kill the first 2 guards at the entrance of the Detention Block.<br /><li>In the large circular Detention Block area, go directly across to the E-NE tunnel.  Dodge the mobs if you can (easily done at level 70+).<br /><li>Kill the 2 guards at the entrance to the "Halls of the Law".  The large circular area (the Ring of Law) will be on your left in the mini-map.<br /><li>Head into the "Halls of the Law" corridor and take the first left after a few dozen paces.  You will now be in the "Ring of Law".  The entrance gate will <b>close and lock</b> a few seconds after you enter.  So make sure everyone goes in at the same time.<br /><li>High Justice Grimstone will appear and sentence you to death.  The first mobs spawn from the eastern entrance.  Do <b>not</b> enter the corridor (you can get locked in) but let them simply wander out and find you.  It may take 10-20 seconds before they come out and run around.  Repeat the process for the northern entrance.<br /><li>After the event, the west gate (exit) and south gate (entrance) will open.  Head out the western gate and up the ramp.<br /><li>At the top of the ramp, upon entering the East Garrison, stop and do a U-turn to the right and go up the second set of stairs to the upper area of the Ring of Law.  This is where a lot of folks get turned around.<br /><li>Note that if you had the Shadowforge Key, you can skip directly to the East Garrison and bypass the Ring of Law event (as well as skipping the Detention Block).  But when going after Pyromancer Loregrain, it doesn't matter that much.<br /><li>As you exit out the east side of the upper Ring of Law spectator area, you will enter the Shrine of Thaurissan corridor.  Pyromancer Loregrain is to the right (to the left is the bridge leading to the eastern half of Shadowforge City).</ul><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/w965TeVu56w?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/w965TeVu56w?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />I spent a lot of time in BRD this week hunting this recipe (and a few others).  This instance is huge and still one of my favorites.
