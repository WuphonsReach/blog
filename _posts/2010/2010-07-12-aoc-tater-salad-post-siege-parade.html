After a siege, the 40-odd Taters decided to parade through Old Tarantia and into the trade post.<br /><br />Sieges can have as many as 48v48 going at it in the "Border Kingdom" zones (one for each of the 3 main cultures).  The goal is to erect catapults, destroy walls or gates, get inside and then repeat the process for the inner wall.  Finally, you'll get far enough inside that you can destroy the actual keep.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RQbuqoR7XGI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RQbuqoR7XGI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />(Give it a few hours and it should be available in a much higher quality.
