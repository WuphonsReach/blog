Tater Salad takes a keep that is undefended.  Players are standing on the roof of the inner keep to enjoy the fireworks.  We were hoping for a better defense, but when we showed up - there were zero defenders.  So we ended up spending a somewhat boring 45 minutes taking out the walls and the central keep.<br /><br />The highlight of the attack was setting up to destroy the inner keep.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wRrMINUXbG0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/wRrMINUXbG0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
