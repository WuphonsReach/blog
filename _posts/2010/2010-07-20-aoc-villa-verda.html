A partial run through Villa Verda in the Old Tarantia Noble District.  The "villas" are single-player instanced dungeons that automatically adjust themselves to the player's level upon entry.  They're popular because they're moderately easy to do, always have level adjusted mobs and there's no competition for mobs.<br /><br />Normally, you'll hit the villas at about level 40 when you get a handful of quests that take you to the Noble District.  But, you can also come back at later times and get additional random quests for these dungeons (there are about five villas) with a short cool-down timer (about 4 hours?).<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xJySgelOt8c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xJySgelOt8c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />The original footage for this was recorded with FRAPS at 1600x900 resolution and downsized to 720p (1280x720) using ffmpeg and x264 at a CRF of 20.  Which gave me a 720p file at around 5.5Mbps, including the 128Kbps AC3 audio track.
