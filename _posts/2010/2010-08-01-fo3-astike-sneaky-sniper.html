Starting stats for Astike, who is going to be a rather sneaky sniper type.  More of a thief then a brawler, firing from cover and evading retribution.<br /><br />STR - 2<br />PER - 7<br />END - 2<br />CHA - 7<br />INT - 6<br />AGI - 8<br />LUC - 8<br /><br />Planned perks:<br /><br />2 - Black Widow<br />3 - Intense Training<br />4 - Educated<br />5 - Child at Heart<br />6 - Gunslinger<br />7 - Commando<br />8 - Scrounger<br /><br />During the GOAT, I took "Lockpick" (35 points), "Medicine" (33 points) and "Sneak" (37 points).  Which is 3 picks taken from the list of the "big 7" skills that are useful for new players:<br /><br />Explosives<br />Lockpick<br />Medicine<br />Repair<br />Science<br />Small Guns<br />Sneak<br /><br />It was a bit of a toss-up between taking "Medicine" vs "Barter" at the start though.  With the "Child at Heart" perk planned for level 5, a higher "Speech" skill could come in handy at getting through some quests and could be useful in role play of someone who can sweet talk their way out of trouble.<br /><br />For the XP adjustment tool, I'm going to leave it at the default setting until at least level 5 or so.  At which point I'll back it off to 50% of normal.<br /><br />I'll likely do The Pitt and Mothership Zeta early for a good weapon and cash as well as access to the ammo press.  I don't care too much for MZ, but it's a nice way of getting a lot of caps to start.  I tend to leave Point Lookout until the early teens as well as Anchorage.
