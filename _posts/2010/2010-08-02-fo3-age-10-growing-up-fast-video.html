See also my previous post on this called "<a href="http://blog.wuphonsreach.org/2009/08/fo3-age-10.shtml">Age 10</a>".<br /><br />Things you'll want to keep in mind:<br /><ul><li>There's a few different ways to approach things in this segment.  So save right at the start and try again if you're not content with the outcome.</li><li>The [Tab] key will bring up the Pipboy, pressing and holding [Tab] will turn the Pipboy light on and off.  The light provides a small (few meters at the most) bubble of light around you, useful for exploring dark environments.</li><li>Some conversations are triggered by proximity.  As soon as you get close to the person, your camera will swing around and you'll be forcibly engaged in conversation.</li><li>I generally remap the "Use" key to [F] instead of the default of [E].</li><li>The [R] key will ready your weapon (or fists), reload it, or if held down it will put the weapon (or fists) away.</li><li>When fighting unarmed, [Left-Click] to throw a pair of punches and [Right-Click] to bring up your fists and block.</li><li>If you're looking at your inventory in the Pipboy, [Left-Click] will use/apply the item (such as a Stimpak or reading a skillbook like the comic book you were given).  [Right-Click] will drop the item to the ground at your feet (if it can be dropped).</li></ul>I've split up the Birthday Party videos into two sections (due to YouTube limits).  These videos do contain spoilers, but they don't show every possible conversation tree.<br /><br /><object height="385" width="640"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZWs29wDWgHw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZWs29wDWgHw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="385" width="640"></embed></object><br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oM3KGtEAyBs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oM3KGtEAyBs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
