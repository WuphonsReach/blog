Shows what happens when you leave Vault 101.  The safe and switch right  outside Vault 101 are added by the PC mod called <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2812">choose_XP</a> (ID #2812 at  Fallout3Nexus).  It lets you change your rate of XP gain on the fly by  using the item.  Shows lockpicking and one of the Enclave's roaming  eyebots.<br /><br />There are other mods in use here, a few minor texture replacements, but this is pretty close to vanilla gameplay at this point.<br /><br />I tend to leave Choose_XP set to the default (or 100%) level for the first half a dozen levels.  Then once I get up around 8-12 and have a good set of skills, I back off to 50% XP.  If I still feel like I'm leveling too fast and not managing to explore enough, I'll back off to 33% XP.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LBuxFsBhm_8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LBuxFsBhm_8&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
