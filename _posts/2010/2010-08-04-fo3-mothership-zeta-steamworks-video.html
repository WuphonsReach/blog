Fallout 3, Mothership Zeta DLC expansion. This section of the mothership is called "Steamworks" and contains alien workers (not hostile) along with regular aliens and ceiling mounted turrets.<br /><br />Overall, MZ isn't one of my favorite areas and I don't care for the sound effects of the alien weapons when you get a sneak attack or critical damage shot.<br /><br />I am using MMM (Mart's Mutant Mod) for DLC Zeta, so there is some increased spawn action going on here, so I get a few more aliens then normal.<br /><br />Aliens and corridors, and more aliens in more corridors.  MZ can be a bit repetitive at times... but after running through it I usually end up gaining 3-4 levels and come back to the wastelands with tens of thousands of caps worth of loot.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tTsXXPna5Q4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tTsXXPna5Q4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />At the end of the entire MZ DLC I had approximately:<br /><ul><br /><li>(106) Adapted Biogel (25 caps)<br /><li>(138) Alien Epoxy (25 caps)<br /><li>(77) Alien Squid Food (1 cap)<br /><li>(69) Alien Worm Food (1 cap)<br /><li>(8-12) units each of Buffout, Jet, Med-X, Mentats, Psycho, Rad-X, RadAway (10-20 caps)<br /><li>(30-40) Stimpaks (25 caps)<br /><li>(60+) Alien Atomizer (232-358 caps)<br /><li>(115) Large Alien Crystals (20 caps)<br /><li>(151) Small Alien Crystals (10 caps)<br /><li>(427) Alien Power Cells (10 caps)<br /><li>(4927) Alien Power Modules (10 caps)<br /><li>Plus probably another 5000-10000 caps worth of misc loot<br /></ul><br /><br />Prices listed are at 100 Barter.  The conservative estimate, if I could get full value, is that I hauled about 93,000 caps worth of loot back from the mothership.  Maybe closer to 95,000+ if I count up all of the misc junk.  With 180 weight carry capacity, it takes me 8-12 trips to haul everything back to Megaton.  But you'll probably only have a barter of about 30-50, so figure on getting about 1/3 to 1/2 of the listed values.<br /><br />Selling all of it off is something that I tend to do over the next dozen levels.  I typically start with the big heavy items like Alien Disruptors.  I'll also carry around a few hundred APMs (Alien Power Modules) and some of the crystals for barter in case I need a quick cash influx.  The APMs and crystals have zero weight, so they're not a problem to carry.<br /><br />Later on, when I have a higher barter skill and I've invested in the trade caravans, I sell off the really heavy stuff.  The Alien Drone Cannons are worth about 900-1500 caps, but have a weight of 20.<br /><br />So I never have money problems after running the MZ DLC, but it can be tedious and a bit boring.  The hard part is finding enough ammo to purchase from the traders at Megaton.
