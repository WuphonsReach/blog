Giddyup Buttercup mechanical ponies on the alien mothership.  One of the high points of the Mothership Zeta DLC as the aliens have an apparent fascination with the toy pony.  Includes the audio log by Sally where the aliens show her this section of the ship.<br /><br /><i>Hello, Mr. Alien. Yeah, I know...I'll talk into the thing.<br /><br />I don't know why you brought me back here. We've done this a whole bunch of... Hey! Giddyup Buttercup! Wow!<br /><br />I always wanted one of those!... Why do you have one?<br /><br />I don't understand...What do you want? It's a toy. A TOY. Why are you so excited? <br /><br />You're weird.</i><br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-G93pu5MsnU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-G93pu5MsnU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
