(Contains spoilers) Farragut West Station, dealing with the ghouls in the first area by making use of the gas leak.  A few key mods are in effect: Mart's Mutant Mod adds additional spawns and also makes possible that ghouls will not stay dead until their head is destroyed.  Darker Interiors is used to reduce the level of ambient light in the location, making the use of Nightvision Goggle mods and Pipboy Light mods essential.<br /><br />There was something buggy with the ghoul at the end, the corpse model did not show a head, but the head shows up in VATS.  Combat shotguns work best for issuing the coup de gr√¢ce to the ghoul's head after they're dead to ensure that they don't come back to haunt you.<br /><br />I don't recall what level of ambient light was used for the cell location when this was recorded.  I will probably increase the ambient brightness to 8:8:8 RGB the next time I edit my custom version of the "Darker Interiors - Fear the Dark" mod.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/obcGYJQG5B4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/obcGYJQG5B4&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
