One of the mods that I use is called MMM (Martigen's Mutant Mod).  If you thought Super Mutant Behemoths were large and a PITA, well the mod adds Gargantuans which are even larger and meaner.<br /><br />If you are very very unlucky, you can even discover them out in the middle of nowhere.  At first, I didn't notice the big orange thing as it was obscured by the monorail track support.  It wasn't until I started my attack on the Super Mutant Brutes that I realized what it was.<br /><br />For my 3rd attempt - I simply ran far far away without engaging that group.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vRQQ_YZBLTc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vRQQ_YZBLTc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
