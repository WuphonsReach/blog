Released the first version of <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=14131">Deadlier Explosive Traps</a> this weekend.  Only 2 responses so far, but 1 endorsement and 2 positive comments. It's not a very complex mod, other then creating the 2nd special effect for the Baby Carriage Trap.  Definitely something that I'll consider revisiting for Fallout 3: New Vegas this fall/winter.<br /><br />Play testing continues, but things look very good.  It's important to me to have grenades that actually pack a punch when dealing with MMM's increased spawns.  With vanilla grenades, I'd toss one, and have almost no effect when it lands in a pack of super-mutants.  With the adjustments, any regular super-mutants who are alerted will be severely wounded or killed if they are within a few steps.  Bigger and tougher brutes might or might not be killed if they are within 3 meters or so.  Masters and overlords can take the most punishment, but even they won't shrug off a frag grenade.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/AIDl2bacqz0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/AIDl2bacqz0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/N_v57ewOLSM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/N_v57ewOLSM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eZWrHoviRes?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eZWrHoviRes?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br /><b>Full README:</b><br /><br />Deadlier Explosive Traps - 1.00 (Aug 2010) by Wuphon's Reach (wuphonsreach@gmail.com)<br /><br />Adjusts explosive-based traps such as mines and baby carriages to be more deadly. Also affects grenades and other explosive entities.<br /><br />My goal was to make grenades and mines better, without going completely overboard. While this is similar to mods like "Grenade Realism", I chose a different method for making the changes.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The full list of changed items:<br /><br />Baby Carriage Traps:<br /><br />These are now a lot more deadly then before, reflecting that they have (3) frag mines inside them according to the model. They do a lot more damage then before. If you are within disarm range when it goes off, you will probably not survive. Now, when you hear the baby's cry, you need to stand up and run around 10-15 meters away from it to get out of the blast radius.<br /><br />Mines:<br /><br />Mines were basically changed to be deadlier over a larger range then before. For the most part, they are all twice as deadly as the equivalent grenade. I'm still not sure whether I should make the detection range larger. Right now, the detection range is exactly equal to the disarm range (for Explosives skill of 50). However, the lethality range for a ~300 HP player with ~50 DR is probably twice the disarm range.<br /><br />Frag Mines - Now do 4x more damage with a 3x bigger radius. These will kill a 300 HP character if they go off at disarm range. It is possible to get out of the blast range if you are quick about it.<br /><br />Bottlecap Mines - Radius increased about 3x, with 20% boost in damage. These were already pretty dangerous, but the radius was too small.<br /><br />Plasma Mines - 67% more damage, 2.5x radius increase. These are better in close quarters then frag mines. I may boost these a bit down the road.<br /><br />Pulse Mine - 9x more damage, 55% radius increase. These will take away about half the health of an alerted sentry robot.<br /><br />Grenades:<br /><br />All grenades have been changed so that they will explode on contact with another actor. In addition, base critical damage and critical percent multipliers have been added, which means they will do uneven damage in a pack of mobs, but they all pack a big punch. The frag variants are more likely to severely wound/cripple limbs then the default.<br /><br />Frag Grenade - 2x more damage, 55% radius increase. However, the critical chance has been greatly increased. These are now very deadly, if you stand there and let one bounce around your feet you will end up with crippled limbs.<br /><br />Nuka-Grenade - Same damage, 75% larger radius. The end result is that these now have a much larger sweet spot even though the damage was not upped. I may eventually dig in and figure out how to make the resulting flames do more damage.<br /><br />Plasma Grenade - 67% more damage, same radius. Better for close-quarters combat since they have a slightly smaller range then the frag grenades.<br /><br />Pulse Grenade - 5x more damage, same radius. These will now put a serious dent in sentry robots.<br /><br />Misc Explosions:<br /><br />Eyebots - Now have a bigger bang when they go boom. Doubled the damage, but left the radius the same.<br /><br />Glowing Ones - Slightly more damage, but increased the visual area of effect to match the effect radius.<br /><br />Gas Trap - Increased damage by 4x, but I'll have to see how it plays out.<br /><br />Electrical Boxes - 50% more damage. These are the square boxes that you see in underground tunnels that explode when they take damage.<br /><br />Fat Man - 50% more damage, but also a 90% bigger radius. This means that you'd better be very careful playing around with the Fat Man in close quarters. Attempting to use this on the Behemoth Super Mutant at GNR will probably make the Brotherhood of Steel very angry at you. I've tested this with the MMM mod and a semi-direct hit will take about 1/3 of a Gargantuan's health away. It definitely makes carrying the Fat Man around for emergencies a worthwhile choice for big gun users.<br /><br />Cars - 67% more damage. These were already pretty nasty, but now they are worse.<br /><br />Buses - 50% more damage and 25% bigger radius. A bigger boom for your buck. When a bus catches on fire, you'd better run.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Version history:<br /><br />1.00 Aug 2010 - First release, not fully play tested to see whether changes are in line with what I wanted. Preliminary testing looks good though.
