Random factoid:<br /><br />Last time I ran Mothership Zeta DLC I hauled home about 93,000 caps worth of loot (at perfect prices).  This time I came back with about 86,000 caps, but I didn't have MMM's increased spawns running and I generally didn't pickup shock batons or alien disruptors.<br /><br />One big money pile in the sky is about all that DLC is worth...
