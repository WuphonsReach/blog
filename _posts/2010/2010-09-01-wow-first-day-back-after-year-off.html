Reactivated my WoW account late Tuesday, but didn't really play with it until tonight.  Things are different after a year, but not radically, and the core group of people that I enjoyed spending time with are still there.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MnaOmWQYLH4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/MnaOmWQYLH4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />So, after patching everything (including the dozens of addons), I managed to:<br /><br />- role-play a bit<br />- work on my "the Insane" title faction grind<br />- ran a dungeon with guildies<br />- did the random battleground of the day<br />- fought in Wintergrasp<br />- made a list of what I want to buy with Emblems of Triumph (EoT)<br /><br />I'm plumb tuckered out.<br /><br />For the record, after looking at what I can buy with EoT (Emblems of Triumph) for my warlock, and looking at what she already has (mostly IL/219 stuff from Ulduar-10), I'm going to go for:<br /><br />50 EoT - T9 Kel’Thuzad’s (Gul’dan’s) Leggings of Conquest<br />30 EoT - T9 Kel’Thuzad’s (Gul’dan’s) Gloves of Conquest<br />35 EoT - Band of the Invoker<br />25 EoT - Brimstone Igniter<br /><br />It sounds like I'll need a lot of EoTs, but every dungeon boss in heroic-mode level 80 dungeons drop them, so you can get 3-4 per dungeon run.  Plus you get either 2 EoF (Emblem of Frost) or 2 EoT for running dungeons using the "Looking for Dungeon" (a.k.a. Looking for Random Pick-Up Group) tool.  Most heroic-mode dungeons only take 15-30 minutes to run now, so it's not hard to pickup a dozen EoTs in a day.  And I already have 38 EoTs from back when the only way to get them was by running the weekly Ulduar-10 raid (where you might get 8 per week).<br /><br />I plan on skipping most of the T9 pieces, especially the head/shoulders because I think they look horrid compared to the very lovely T8 warlock set head/shoulders.  However, the T10 warlock head/shoulders for Alliance-side characters looks very nice and I'll gladly trade up to T10 from T8 in those slots.  Here's what the T8 looks like:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/WoW/Characters/Xavron/Xavron-T8-HeadShoulders-LoginScreen-2010-09-02.jpg" width="355" height="453">
