I've been working on the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=2336">Insane in the Membrane achievement</a> for a while (even before I took a break from World of Warcraft).  One of the things that you have to do is gain back all the goblin town reputation that you trash during an early portion of the achievement.  The fastest way to get it back is to run <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Dire_Maul">Dire Maul North</a> over and over and over.  Plus, it gets you "Librams" which are needed for another quest that gives reputation to yet another faction that you're trying to reach "exalted" status with.<br /><br />On each run, your goal is to free Knot (the goblin) and collect at least one "<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18240">Ogre Tannin</a>".  The <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18250">key</a> is a random drop off of the guards (15-25% chance) or it's a rare (1% or so) drop off of any other ogre.  So, depending on when you get the key will determine what mobs you kill and which mobs you can bypass.  You can only have (1) copy of the key at a time and it gets used up when you free Knot.  So sometimes you'll run in, free Knot, then pickup another key on the way back out.<br /><br />You'll be doing this at least 80 times...<br /><br /><b>The basics of a Dire Maul run</b><br /><br />If you already have a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18250">Gordok Shackle Key</a>, then you need to:<ol><li>Kill Guard Mol'dar for his door key (far side of entrance area courtyard, drag him up the ramp).<br /><li>Bypass as many ogres as possible.<br /><li>Skip Stomper Kreeg.<br /><li>Go to Fengus's Chest and get the key for the second floor door (avoid Guard Fengus).<br /><li>Go through the locked door and down the long hallway.<br /><li>Avoid Guard Slip'kik and head straight to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=14338">Knot Thimblejack</a>.<br /><li>Talk to Knot, then talk to him again and do the "Free Knot!" quest.<br /><li>Once Knot is free, loot <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/object=179501">Knot Thimblejack's Cache</a>, which sometimes contains an <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18240">Ogre Tannin</a>.<br /><li>Go ahead and kill Guard Slip'kik now (maybe you get a shackle key for the next run) and head upstairs.<br /><li>Kill the ogres near the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/object=179499">Ogre Tannin Basket</a>.<br /><li>Loot the Ogre Tannin Basket and pickup the bind-on-pickup <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18240">Ogre Tannin</a>.<br /><li>Kill the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=14351">Gordok Bushwacker</a> which spawns.</ol>At this point you have two choices, head farther in and kill Captain Kromcrush for a chance at his key, or kill all the ogres on the way back to the entrance in hopes of a key.  I generally just turn around and head back towards the entrance, killing everything along the way.  Especially Guard Fengus, who I avoided on the way in.<br /><br />If you <b>do not</b> already have a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18250">Gordok Shackle Key</a>, then you need to:<ol><li>Kill Guard Mol'dar for his door key (far side of entrance area courtyard, drag him up the ramp).<br /><li>Kill as many ogres as possible until you have a shackle key.<br /><li>Kill Stomper Kreeg if you don't have a shackle key yet.<br /><li>Go to Fengus's Chest and get the key for the second floor door.<br /><li>If you don't have a shackle key yet, kill Guard Fengus).<br /><li>Go through the locked door and down the long hallway.<br /><li>Kill Guard Slip'kik if you don't yet have a shackle key yet.<br /><li>Talk to Knot, then talk to him again and do the "Free Knot!" quest.  If you don't have a key, go upstairs to the Ogre Tannin Basket instead and come back to Knot later.<br /><li>Once Knot is free, loot <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/object=179501">Knot Thimblejack's Cache</a>, which sometimes contains an <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18240">Ogre Tannin</a>.<br /><li>Go ahead and kill Guard Slip'kik now (maybe you get a key) and head upstairs.<br /><li>Kill the ogres near the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/object=179499">Ogre Tannin Basket</a>.<br /><li>Loot the Ogre Tannin Basket and pickup the bind-on-pickup <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18240">Ogre Tannin</a>.<br /><li>Kill the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=14351">Gordok Bushwacker</a> which spawns.</ol>Basically, until you get a key, you should go kill every guard up to the area where Knot is chained up.  If none of the three guards or the drunk ogre give you a key, head upstairs to the tannin basket and get that item.  Kill all the ogres up there and see if you find one.  In the case where you still don't have a shackle key, go all the way up and kill Captain Kromcrush.  Hopefully you have a key by this point and can go free Knot.<br /><br />Once Knot is free, I kill most of the ogres on the way back out until I get a key drop.  Once I have a new shackle key, my goal is to exit the instance as fast as possible with my ogre tannin and shackle key.<br /><br /><b>Videos</b><br /><br />In this run, the key dropped off the first pack of trash mobs, so I only had to kill the first guard for the door key to get to Knot.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/42ZpEp9_-TE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/42ZpEp9_-TE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Key dropped off of Guard Mol'dar.  Since he also drops the key for the first door, you always have to kill him.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vve0aB4uAq8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vve0aB4uAq8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br /><b>Ogre Tannin</b><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=18240">Ogre Tannin</a> is not unique and will stack.  I strongly suggest simply collecting it until later.  The resulting <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/quest=5518">Gordok Ogre Suit</a> is flagged as "unique" (you can only own one) and Knot will make multiple at a time if you have the tannin and the other materials.  However, if you have a portable <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=40768">MOLL-E mailbox</a> (which engineers can create and temporarily place with a two hour cooldown) or the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=44998">Argent Squire</a> (four hour cooldown) then you can mail the extra suits off to alts.  You can have multiple unique items sitting in your alt's mailbox, they just can't accept the package into their inventory if they already have one.<br /><br />I wait until either my 2 hour cooldown on the mailbox is up, or until I have the raw materials needed to turn in about 20 of the tannins.  Each turn-in gets me 75 reputation points, so 20 x 75 = 1500 reputation.<br /><br />If you're not an engineer or you don't have an Argent Squire, get someone to come along every few hours so you can do a bunch of ogre suit turn-ins.
