<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Zalazane%27s_Fall">Zalazane's Fall</a> event, a precursor to the Cataclysm expansion later in 2010.<br /><br />Part 1 of 5 shows the basics of getting the letter in Ogrimmar, then riding south to Sen'jin Village to help the Vol'jin's Darkspears.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/BIw_RcH8m-Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/BIw_RcH8m-Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Part 2 of 5, we get a quest to capture frogs for "Da Perfect Spies" then we get to throw said frogs in "Frogs Away".  We get a nice flying tour of the existing Echo Isles during the bombing run style quest as we plant frogs on the isles.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5C5pdA8hi5k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5C5pdA8hi5k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Part 3 of 5, head north back to Razor Hill in Durotar and bring back five volunteers in "Trollin' For Volunteers".  Then we head over to Echo Isles for "Lady Of Da Tigers".  This also provides an in-game explanation of why troll druids will exist after Cataclysm is released.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/q_iytCeYCxk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/q_iytCeYCxk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Part 4 of 5 is to participate in the "Dance of De Spirits" and listen to the witch doctor's speech.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YAN3QPoPhCU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YAN3QPoPhCU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Sadly, I don't have a level 75+ character horde-side, so I wasn't able to participate in the final battle.  This was very disappointing because Blizzard could have easily done some sort of level-boosting for the lower level classes during that event.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nTZ5nVd9UNE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nTZ5nVd9UNE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Overall, I was less impressed with the quests that could be done prior to level 75 on horde-side then alliance-side for this event.  There was no marker telling you where to find the lady tiger on the isles, and when the quest ends due to level - there's no good explanation of it if you happen to miss the final quest text.<br /><br />Blizzard should have either made the NPCs for the final quest tell you "you're too young", or the quest NPC should have whispered you to that effect when you turned in the final quest.  That would have given younger players a way to double-check that they're talking to the right NPC, or give them something in the chat box that they can refer back to.<br /><br />(Blogger.com is having issues this morning...)
