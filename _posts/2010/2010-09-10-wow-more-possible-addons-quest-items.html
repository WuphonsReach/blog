<a href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/qbar.aspx">QBar</a> looks interesting, it takes all those quest items in your bags and puts them on a bar for you to use.  Now, Blizzard has made things a lot better with their new quest tracker panel released during the WotLK era, but there are still a few items/quests where the item you need to use will not show up.  Or maybe you want to minimize the quest tracker to give you more screen real estate.<br /><br />The other option for things like bombing runs is to create a macro, then assign it to a hot-key.<blockquote>#showtooltip<br />/use Arcane Charges<br />/use Fire Bomb</blockquote>The bigger advantage of creating the macro and assigning it to a key is that often you can get two shots off before the actual cool-down (CD) gets in the way.  Just keep adding "/use (itemname)" lines for other bombing type quests, which works as long as you never try to do two different bombing run quests at the same time.<br /><br />I used to use an addon named "BombersBuddy" for my bombing run quests, but that hasn't been updated in a year or two and no longer works.<br /><br /><b>Other misc links</b><br /><br /><a href="http://warlockgalaxy.blogspot.com/2010/03/add-on-extreme.html">A Warlock's Guide to the Galaxy - Add-on Extreme</a>
