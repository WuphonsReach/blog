One of the things on my to-do list prior to WoW's Cataclysm expansion is to hit up the old-world zones that are going to be changing and take one last look around.<br /><br />Questing in Barrens, pre-Cataclysm. Starts at Camp Taurajo in the south, fly north to the Crossroads, then west to start the Counterattack! event. After a while, Krom'zar will appear so that he can be defeated and his banner taken.<br /><br />This quest had been in my books for quite a while and it as very much non-obvious where to start it.  Turns out that if you miss the event when it first spawns, you have to talk to the quest-giver NPC again and ask "Where is Krom'zar?".<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/710FEegH13Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/710FEegH13Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
