Digging up some oldies.  First up is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion which I first played back around 2007.  This shows the exit from the starter area (the City Prison Sewer) which puts you on the northeast corner of City Isle.  Not a lot of action in the first 12 minutes of play, but it shows the user interface (inventory, quest journal) and gives a brief look at what the geography and graphics looked like back in 2007.<br /><br />(Fallout 3 was also done by Bethesda, using the same engine as Oblivion.)<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/sxR20XaFGFY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/sxR20XaFGFY?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Exploring the Imperial City Prison area in the early dawn hours, talking to guards, going down into the cell block area.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qI-HF_odGxA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qI-HF_odGxA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Entering the Imperial City's market district for the first time.  Reading a bulletin on the wall, talking to NPCs to get the latest rumors and gossip, and interacting with vendors.  TES4 has a social mini-game where you had to use different conversational gambits in an attempt to curry favor with individual vendors to get better prices.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Q1yWUMcp54?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9Q1yWUMcp54?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />Note: This was originally FRAPS'd at 1280x720, but was sized down to 720x480 and stuffed onto a DVD using MPEG2.  Then pulled back off the DVD using Handbrake and stuffed into a CRF 22 h.264/x264 format.  So there's a little bit of MPEG2 "fuzziness" but the video is fairly clean and everything is still legible.
