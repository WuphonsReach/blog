Roads in Civilization V now have a maintenance cost.  At a cost of 1gp/turn for roads and 2gp/turn for rail it adds up quick.  This means that you need to choose carefully where you run roads and rail lines.  <br /><br />A good general design principle is to "think like a tree and leaf".  Start at the center city, connect outwards to the nearest 3 cities.  Then connect outwards from those 3 cities to their nearest neighbors.  Only add cross-connects once you have a steady income surplus or you have a special need like a long border with the enemy where you need fast reaction across the front.<br /><br />Here's a sample road network in one of my games (Fractal, Large).  I've over-drawn the road network using a big purple line to make it more obvious.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/Civ5/SampleRoadNetwork1-Sep2010.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/Civ5/SampleRoadNetwork1-Sep2010.jpg" width="640" height="506"></a><br /><br />Kagoshima to Osaka (in the lower right) road did not exist for a long time until I was making over 20 gold/turn regularly.<br /><br />The roads from London to Warrick and Newcastle were laid down by the AI - and the AI did a good job.<br /><br />Note that Satsuma-Kyoto is not highlighted in yellow any more.  That road used to be what the trade network ran across, until Satsuma added in a Harbor.  Now the trade traffic apparently goes via sea lanes to another city with a Harbor (probably Nara or Kyoto).
