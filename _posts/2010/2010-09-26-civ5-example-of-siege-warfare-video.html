Civilization V 1.0.0.17 release.  Playing as Japan on a large/fractal map on warlord difficulty.  Japan has been at war with England since the dawn of time when they tried to horn in on our peninsula.  So after multiple wars, things have finally reached the point where England has only two cities left.<br /><br />Japan is not alone in taking down England, a third AI empire (Siam?) has decided to join in.  Mostly they provide a distraction for the city's ranged attack rather then any actual help.  But the AI in the release is so bad that apparently it's only worse on defense then offense as AIs do manage to take cities from each other.<br /><br />After taking the remaining two cities (at 2m 50s), England gets removed completely from the game.  An amusing note is that England lost a city to a tiny city-state earlier, giving rise to the humor of a city-state that controls two cities.  (Look for "Dover" in blue at about the 4 minute mark. "Dublin" is a city-state, and "Dover" is the city that they took from England.)<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EsBFMgifBYM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EsBFMgifBYM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
