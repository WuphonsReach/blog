Here's the original Baldur's Gate title sequence and introduction movies.  This was done back in 1999.  Back then, 15fps movies in tiny resolutions were all the rage and somewhat cutting edge.  Now it looks a bit dated.  Yes, the cut scene videos don't fill the screen, but that's because the original video was letterboxed when presented to the player during the intro.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jZP6-DsxJPI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jZP6-DsxJPI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br />This is the prologue (or introduction) area of the game where you are a young ward of Garion.  Garion has tasked you with collecting supplies for a sudden journey.  As you wander around Candlekeep, you will do a small bit of fighting as the forces of darkness are already trying to get at you before you even leave.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ff1cUwAzS9U?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ff1cUwAzS9U?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object>
