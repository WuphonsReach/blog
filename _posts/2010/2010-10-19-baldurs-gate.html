A bunch of gameplay videos from Baldur's Gate (using EasyTutu UI at 800x600):<br /><br /><b>Visiting Beregost for the first time</b><br /><br />This is the cut-scene that plays the first time you visit Beregost. It also shows how to disband Xzar and Montaron from the party. Generally, if you're not going to create a neutral/evil party, you'll want to get rid of Xzar and Montaron. I almost always ditch them in Beregost before picking up Garrick.<br /><br />Note: When disbanding NPCs, it's better to do it in an indoor area like a tavern. If you leave them behind in a tavern, they're more likely to stay around should you need them in the future.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zhjJlieVfpQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zhjJlieVfpQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br /><b>Garrick and Silke</b><br /><br />Silke is an early "boss fight" that you can encounter in Beregost. It can be difficult at lower levels unless you have Sleep or Silence to deal with her.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Pqa4W3x623c?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Pqa4W3x623c?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object><br /><br /><b>Nashkel and Minsc</b><br /><br />Nashkel is probably the third town that you'll visit in Baldur's Gate (after Friendly Arms Inn and Beregost). It's not that big, but has an inn, merchant and temple.<br /><br />One of the fun easter eggs in BG1 is to click on the various tombstones in the graveyard.<br /><br />You'll also meet up with Minsc in Nashkel. I suggest avoiding him if most of your party is still level 1 (or 2) as he has a time-sensitive quest that you must do right away. Still, Minsc is probably the most memorable character in the series and worth adding to your party.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1wtrAuSQJWk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1wtrAuSQJWk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></embed></object>
