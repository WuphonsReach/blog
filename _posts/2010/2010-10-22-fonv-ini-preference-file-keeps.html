Looks like Steam was added to Fallout New Vegas late in development.  There are half a dozen INI files in the steamapp folder tree for FO:NV.  For instance there are:<br /><br />C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegas\<br /><br />Fallout_default.ini<br />low.ini<br />medium.ini<br />high.ini<br />VeryHigh.ini<br /><br />Some people have an INI file in the following Steam folder as well (apparently part of Steam Cloud, which is currently disabled for Fallout New Vegas):<br /><br />C:\Program Files\Steam\userdata\########\remote\<br /><br />falloutprefs.ini<br /><br />Then there's the (2) INI files in your My Documents\My Games:<br /><br />C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\My Documents\My Games\FalloutNV<br /><br />Fallout.ini<br />FalloutPrefs.ini<br /><br /><b>Reference Links</b><br /><br /><a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1126174-falloutprefsini-reverting-to-default/">FalloutPrefs.ini reverting to default</a><br /><a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1125980-falloutini-keeps-reverting-to-default/">Fallout.ini keeps reverting to default</a><br /><a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1124494-cant-edit-falloutini/">Can't edit Fallout.ini Keeps getting replaced, preventing performance tweaks</a><br /><br /><b>So which file do you edit?</b><br /><br />Well, that depends on whether you run the FONV launcher when you startup Fallout New Vegas or not.  And when the Steam Cloud is re-enabled, it's going to throw yet another INI file into the mix.  Rumor has it that the proper file to edit is the "Fallout_default.ini" under "steamapps\common\fallout new vegas\", at least if you use the launcher from Steam (or via the shortcut that Steam creates).
