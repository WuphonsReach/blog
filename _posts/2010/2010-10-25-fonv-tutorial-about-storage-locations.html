As with Fallout 3, one of the first questions in New Vegas is "where do I safely store my stuff?". Back in the days of Oblivion, Bethesda coded things so that (nearly) all containers would reset with new contents whenever the parent cell (room/area) was reset 72 game hours after the player last visited. This resulted in a lot of pain and suffering in the Oblivion days as you would find a nice place to stash stuff, only to have it all vanish a few hours later when the cell reset.<br /><br />In Fallout 3 (and now New Vegas), very few containers are tagged to respawn. It's mostly just vendor's containers or containers that are owned by someone. So, 90% or even 99% of the time, putting items into a container and then going elsewhere for a few game days or weeks is perfectly safe.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I decided to test this in Fallout New Vegas in Goodsprings.<br /><br />Goodsprings is ideal from a lot of points. It's accessible right from the start. It has a Mohave Express box, so you can send stuff back here without physically traveling back to here all the time. It has a repair bench and ammo bench right around the corner. There's a vendor right inside the General Store along with an unowned bed to the north in a trailer. The only thing that is missing is a convenient campfire for cooking food on.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/W4bdX81tUAg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/W4bdX81tUAg?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
