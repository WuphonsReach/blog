Prior to World of Warcraft's Cataclysm, I was leveling up a druid alt in Feralas.  One thing that I had never noticed before was that the sea giants (wave striders) periodically have issues with gas and blow bubbles out of their nether regions.  It's a rare animation and you sometimes have to wait a long time to see it.<br /><br />I haven't been back to Feralas yet to see if the Wave Striders all got swept away by the tides, although I suspect that other sea giant varieties still have the animation.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/n8y5KYHxJxM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/n8y5KYHxJxM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />And for those who didn't get a chance to login to Moon Guard last night, here's what you missed:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/WoW/MoonGuardIsFull/MoonGuardLoginQueue-2010-11-23.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/WoW/MoonGuardIsFull/thumb640/MoonGuardLoginQueue-2010-11-23.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="World of Warcraft - Moon Guard - Login Queue"></a><br /><br />Guildmates say that the queue got up into the 1100s later that evening with 15-20 minute waits.
