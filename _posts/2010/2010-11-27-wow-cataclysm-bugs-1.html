World of Warcraft Cataclysm is here and so are some amusing bugs. <br /><br />In Felwood, there's a quest called "Do the Imp-Possible" where you have to go capture Impsy and stuff him in a sack. Which is all well and good, except that your character then has a sack hanging off their rump.<br /><br />Well, on feral druids, said sack looks a bit like something you'd like to scrap off by dragging your rump across the ground.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ugc4i5nKwT8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ugc4i5nKwT8?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />If you go out to Stonetalon Mountains, there's a few new mines.  One of them has orc peons carrying rocks out of it or moving rocks around inside of it.  The peons are supposed to look like they're doing work.<br /><br />Except that things didn't quite go as planned and the rocks end up floating in mid-air.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LOOhX8kGxXI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LOOhX8kGxXI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
