In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, all of the old-world zones have been reworked, which means that quests have changed.  There are a lot more "bread-crumb" type quests now that lead you from one area to another after you finish up the quests in a particular location.<br /><br />"We're Here to Do One Thing, Maybe Two..." is the quest that takes you from Silverwind Refuge in Ashenvale down to The Fold in Stonetalon Mountains.  Blizzard has really taken a shine to vehicles since the Wrath of the Lich King expansion and you will find a lot more quests using or centered around vehicles in the old-world zones now.  Unfortunately, the animation isn't always quite there yet and needs to be cleaned up a bit.<br /><br />Quests:<br />We're Here to Do One Thing, Maybe Two...<br />Barrier to Entry<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/P28uRdIZ_vM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/P28uRdIZ_vM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />One of the new quests in World of Warcraft's Cataclysm is "Dream of a Better Tomorrow" where you have to go collect parts for a war machine on the horde-side.  Three of the parts are easy to get to, but the fourth "BD-816 War Apparatus" may be a bit confusing to find.  <br /><br />To get this, you have to swing around the north side of the lake and find the narrow path leading up to the giant water wheel in the sky.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xeLVCxLIAvs?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xeLVCxLIAvs?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />This is "Mr. D's Wild Ride" where you put that war machine to good use.<br /><br />In exchange for an ice-cream cone.<br /><br />Yummy.<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hLo1OTOtPTI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/hLo1OTOtPTI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x2b405b&amp;color2=0x6b8ab6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object>
