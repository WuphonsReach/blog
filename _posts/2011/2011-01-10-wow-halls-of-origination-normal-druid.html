Four fights from Halls of Origination in World of Warcraft (run in normal mode with a druid bear tank).  The four pulls shown here are:<br /><br />- The very first pull in the instance<br />- Temple Guardian Anhuur (01:55)<br />- The sand beetle ambush after elevator (04:40)<br />- Earthrager Ptah (05:35)<br /><br />Addons in use are: VuhDo (unit frames), SunnArt (border artwork), Omen (threat), Recount (DPS tracker), Dominos (action buttons) and Tidy Plates: Threat Plates for enemy mobs.<br /><br />This was my 3rd or so run in HoO and I was still learning the pulls and how to CC (crowd control) them properly.  So it's not a great performance in places and I personally rate it about a B or B-minus.<br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7_gKyx1xxeA?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>
