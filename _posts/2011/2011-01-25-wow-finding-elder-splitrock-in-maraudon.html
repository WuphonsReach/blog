Shows how to find Elder Splitrock down in the Maraudon dungeon in World of Warcraft during the Lunar Festival.  The Maraudon dungeon can be a bit tricky to navigate.<br /><br />The basic instructions are:<br />- Enter the entrance in Desolace (Kalimdor continent).<br />- Look for the wooden cage, followed by the two flights of stairs (0:52).<br />- When you see purple crystals to the left *and* orange to the right, go straight forward into the doorway guarded by a pair of centaur statues.<br />- This passage leads to the portal that takes you to "Earth Song Falls" in Maraudon<br />- Jump down into the pool below (01:45)<br />- Go straight into the cave south of the pool, to the back corner of the cave (02:40)<br />- Go past the dinos until you reach an upward ramp (03:30), left takes you to the stone giants, the right takes you where you want to go.<br />- You'll see that from 03:30 to 05:00, I went left (the wrong way) into the giants, then circled back around to the ramp<br />- Deep Borer mobs will be the first things you see on the right after the T-intersection (05:15)<br />- Go to the right and down the multiple ramps (05:25)<br />- You will enter "Zaeter's Grave" where you go left to the Elder (06:30)<br />- Cross the stone bridge (06:45)<br />- Past even more Deep Borers (07:00)<br />- You will then see Elder Splitrock (07:15)<br /><br />The easiest way back out of that part of Mara is hearth or portal.<br /><br /><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IV0zBJMmRQ4?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>
