File this one under:<br /><br />- Too much rock hauling<br />- Not enough militia training<br />- Bad corridor design<br />- Lack of focus<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/UshulAnur/PoorEntranceDesign/PreliminaryDesign1.png"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/UshulAnur/PoorEntranceDesign/thumb640/PreliminaryDesign1.jpg" width="640" height="371" alt="Dwarf Fortress v0.31.18 - Bad Entrance Design"></a><br /><br />Well, in the summer of year 561, the reaper came in the form of an ambush party that resulted in a complete disaster.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/UshulAnur/PoorEntranceDesign/AmbushInvasionMassacre.png"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/UshulAnur/PoorEntranceDesign/thumb640/AmbushInvasionMassacre.jpg" width="640" height="371" alt="Dwarf Fortress v0.31.18 - Bad Entrance Design"></a><br /><br />So many bad mistakes here.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/UshulAnur/PoorEntranceDesign/Invasion-Annotations.png"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/UshulAnur/PoorEntranceDesign/thumb640/Invasion-Annotations.jpg" width="640" height="371" alt="Dwarf Fortress v0.31.18 - Bad Entrance Design"></a><br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Too slow raising the left drawbridges.  Tried to save too many dwarfs from the farms/exterior.<br /><li>Too slow at raising the drawbridge on the right side.  This pretty much doomed the fortrees.<br /><li>Straight shot to meeting area allowed the enemy to attack all my dwarfs from the entrance.<br /><li>No trained/geared militia.  Combined with their barracks being right on the main passage.  They were in their room training and got absolutely slaughtered.<br /><li>My control room for the bridge levers had a doorway on the wrong side of the final drawbridge.  Once the enemy got inside I could no longer use them.<br /><li>No fresh water inside the fort.  I need a cistern or well.<br /><li>Some bridges were not hooked up to levers yet (too many people hauling rocks).<br /></ul><br /><br />Basically, I need to abandon the 3-tile wide corridor concept with 12 Z-unit deep pits and stick shoring up the main 5-tile wide corridor first.  It needs more bends and bridges at a long (50+ tile) distance away from each other.  So I will save-scum back a year and rework my initial 5-tile wide corridor to take a sharp bend.  Then I will create a downward ramp for 20 tiles or so, then take another 90-degree bend with yet another bridge.
