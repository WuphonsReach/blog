One of the easy ways to earn money early on is towork on some of the <a href="http://www.cheathappens.com/features/gta3/gta3_jumps.asp">unique stunt bonuses</a>.  The first unique stunt pays $5000, the 2nd completed pays $10,000, then $15,000, $20,000 etc and there are 8 unique jumps on the island of Portland where you start.   You'll want a fast car, that is controllable, but sometimes you can get unexpected results from using other vehicles.  I'm not sure that you can do the 8th jump in Portland until you unlock Staunton as it takes place on the upper part of the destroyed bridge.<br /><br />The Stallion (2-door convertible, often pink) and Diablo Stallion (2-door, black with flame trim) is a decent choice for some stunts.  But the handling is a bit soft in the front and it can be hard to steer at top speeds.  The 2-door convertible model is a popular car in Portland so you should be able to find one on any street while the 2-door Diablo can generally only be found in <a href="http://www.gtagaming.com/gta3/gangspc">Diablo territory</a> (just northeast of the Portland hideout).<br /><br />Another good choice is the 4-door Kuruma, which is nearly always alarmed and you can find one down at the Portland Harbor (southeast corner of Portland).  Handling on the Kuruma is very good, it's fairly nimble and good on straightaways.  A good choice as a getaway car if you need to travel with multiple companions.<br /><br />The gold-plated choice that many people like is the 2-door Banshee, which is a high powered sports car up in the northeast corner of Portland.  Very nimble, very quick and takes a fair amount of punishment before you have to abandon it.<br /><br />Callahan Bridge - Eastbound underneath with grassy ramp<br /><br />Took half a dozen tries to get this as you have to clear or land on top of the second horizontal support beam.  You'll have to start as far back as possible and keep the run as straight as possible until you hit the grass ramp.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SymsSMadrIQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Chinatown - Elevated Tracks above the Subway Entrance<br /><br />This was a difficult jump to make.  I tried it with many different cars and finally got some success with a Diablo Stallion.  There's pedestrians and cross traffic that gets in the way, along with lamp posts to the left/right of your target.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4lyFjdgyqU4?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Chinatown - Elevated Train Walkway<br /><br />A fairly straightforward jump with a long straightaway over the grass until you hit the concrete ramp.  This will launch you up and over the elevated walkway with the police bribe.  <br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9SMMa57LToI?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Portland Harbor - Four Tractor Trailers<br /><br />I pulled this off with a Kuruma which is parked right there, but I also pulled it off with an Ambulance.  Amusingly, the ambulance flew farther and did better then a lot of other cars that I tried.  You have to mostly clear the 4th trailer in order for it to count.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i1KGx6_5K7I?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/smntkqyQFBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
