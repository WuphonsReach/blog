(This is not a complete collection of the missions on the first island of Portland.)<br /><br />Luigi Goterelli, Drive Misty for Me - Luigi wants you to take care of business.  Not a difficult mission and is basically a drive from A to B to C.  It introduces you to Joey and the fact that the north side of Portland is Diablo territory.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LB49aQA_c88?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />The Crook (Marty Chonks) - This is first in a series of phone missions that can be picked up from the phone by Joey's near the harbor.  You'll be working for the owner of a pet food factory, who uses some unusual ingredients.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FAv6qSKiE-0?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Toni Cipriani, Taking Out the Laundry - Drive-by shooting is better then stopping and using the grenades.  It allows you to outrun any retribution from accidental collateral damage.  The first time I tried this with the grenades, I ticked off the Leone Mafia in their home territory and promptly got gunned down.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/c0L3E-Mp9Lc?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Toni Cipriani, Blow Fish - Easy mission, as long as you drive slow and careful and are ready for a firefight afterwards.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yeD-e2pFKuQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Cutting the Grass (Salvatore Leone) - Easy mission that involves tailing a snitch.  The only trick to it is that if you get too close, the snitch gets spooked and breaks off the meeting.  Unlike the snitch mission in GTA:SA, this is fairly easy and the snitch isn't that sensitive.  Includes a bit of Chatterbox FM episode with Fernando Martinez. <br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zT_uZeUPPYk?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Salvatore Leone, Last Requests (contains spoilers) - Very easy mission.  Nobody is chasing you and you simply go from A to B to C.  Afterwards, Staunton Island is unlocked so you'll want to explore a bit.  Parts of the clip also show the limits of the x264 encoder at CRF22 (artifacts along some black-colored texture borders). These mostly went away on later clips where I used CRF20.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb8QZ-MO7p8?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
