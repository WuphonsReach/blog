Ray Machowski, "Silence the Sneak" - Ray is not happy with McAffrey who just squealed and turned State's Evidence.  Flush him out of hiding, then hunt him down.  Since you'll be getting a 2-star wanted level as soon as you flush him out, take something where you can survive police attention.  I chose a Yakuza Stinger for the nimbleness.  The hardest part of the mission is getting the grenades through the window.  You have to hold down the mouse button combined with standing just far enough away from the window that the top of the grenade's arc passes through the window frame.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u0m6IzbVixo?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
