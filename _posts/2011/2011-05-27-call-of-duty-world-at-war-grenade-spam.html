Picked up a copy of Call of Duty - World at War off of Steam this week for cheap.  And my first impression is that the developers took the common grenade spam from the old Call of Duty multiplayer matches and taught it to the AI in the CoD:WaW missions.  Back at the start of any multplayer map in CoD / CoD:UO where the two teams would start on opposite sides of a building, everyone would throw their grenades over the top of the building to try for cheap kills.<br /><br />In CoD:WaW a similar thing happens. On the harder difficulties, if you try and find cover, within 20 seconds the AI enemies will start spamming grenades into your cover. Even if they're being shot by your squad mates at point blank range.  It's a cheap AI tactic and makes the harder difficulty levels an exercise in frustration rather then providing a challenge/enjoyment.  It's very much like you have a big fat "kill the player" sign hanging over your head.  On the first mission alone, I've racked up a dozen or so deaths from grenades.<br /><br />So my initial enjoyment of the lovely graphics and sounds in CoD:WaW are immediately diminished by the developer's ham-handed attempt to make it more difficult.
