So, I stumbled across the <a href="http://www.battlefieldbadcompany2.com/globalstats?platform=pc">Bad Company 2 Global Stats</a> page and since it breaks it down by platform, I did a bit of math.  I looked at how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield:_Bad_Company_2">various classes</a> interact on the three platforms (PC, PS3, XBox360).<br /><br />The raw numbers:<br /><br />PC: 104,972,281 hours 4,650,763,830 kills 135,260,246 tags<br />PS3: 117,909,124 hours 4,901,121,790 kills 151,579,700 tags<br />XB360: 127,542,902 hours 5,301,620,870 skills 145,156,176 tags<br /><br />PC: 633,623,408 supplies 320,241,880 repairs 299,168,384 revives 167,482,712 spots<br />PS3: 427,392,312 supplies 224,340,244 repairs 253,881,496 revives 121,793,336 spots<br />XB360: 448,621,304 supplies 298,550,848 repairs 294,633,280 revives 100,264,284 spots<br /><br />"supplies" = dropping a box of supplies for another player (Assault class)<br /><br />"repairs" = player taking the time to repair another player's vehicle (Engineer)<br /><br />"revives" = resurrecting a fallen ally (Medic)<br /><br />"spots" = marking an enemy player on your allies' compasses (not class specific)<br /><br />Even as gross numbers, it's pretty evident that console players do not like to repair or spot for other players.  Or drop supplies for the other players.  If we weight things by hours played we see the following per hour rates:<br /><br />Supplies: 6.04 (PC) 3.62 (PS3) 3.52 (XB360)<br /><br />Repairs: 3.05 (PC) 1.90 (PS3) 2.34 (XB360)<br /><br />Revives: 2.85 (PC) 2.15 (PS3) 2.31 (XB360)<br /><br />Spots: 1.60 (PC) 1.03 (PS3) 0.786 (XB360)<br /><br />Which shows stark contrast in team-focused activities such as dropping an ammo create for another player, or helping out team mates in other ways.  The PC players are well ahead of the console players.  The console players appear to be more "lone wolf" style of players.
