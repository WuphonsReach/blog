This is the current version of the Captain's Quarter (CQ) released by CCP in the Incarna 1.0 patch.  Eventually, it's supposed to be a shared environment where you can interact with other pilots.  And there are supposed to be different CQ designs for the different types of stations.<br /><br />But mostly, right now, it's a resource hog and most players have turned it off.<br /><br />(PS. WTB sprint key...)<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/B1D-KF1zQ1Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Recorded mostly because I wanted to verify my tool chain and to see whether recording in FRAPS RGB mode would work.  Yes, the CQ is normally that dark in-game.  It's a Minmatar station and they're known for flying "rust bucket" ships that do not have polish or flash to them.
