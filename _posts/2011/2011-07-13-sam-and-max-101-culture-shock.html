Brief excerpt from Sam and Max 101: Culture Shock<br /><br />If you liked the old Lucas Arts graphical adventures like Monkey's Island, Grim Fandango, this fits right in with that.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/R7YpnA8fp3A?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />(Unfortunately, due to the rendering system they use, FRAPS tends to lose lip-sync after a few conversations / mini-cut scenes which were rendered at 12fps.  Captured at 1024x768, downsized to SVGA 800x600 before uploading to YouTube.)
