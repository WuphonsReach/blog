Introduction area at the very start of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion where you are locked in a dungeon cell. Shows what the game used to look like with the base textures and UI, with no mods installed.<br /><br />(Old video footage from 2007 showing the vanilla version of Oblivion for the PC.  Recorded as 720p and downsized to 480p for storage on DVD.  The textures back there were nowhere as detailed, and the MPEG2 compression softened it up a bit.)<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7lTi8t41COA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Also, the "well room" area of the tutorial where you pickup armor, a bow, some arrows and get to take target practice on a bucket.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5WupqGvvF0U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Here is what all that can look like on modern hardware with a texture pack installed and the DarnUI along with some other enhancements.  Unfortunately without sound because FRAPS didn't record the audio.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5Dlxdbfizh8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
