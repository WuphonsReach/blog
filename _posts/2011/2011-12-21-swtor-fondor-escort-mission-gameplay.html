Star Wars: The Old Republic - Space Combat - Fondor Escort mission.<br /><br />The is the very first mission that you'll get when you finish up with questing on Coruscant.  It took me a few tries to figure things out, so here are the key tips that you should know.  The left-mouse fires the lasers while the right mouse (if the target cursor is over a circled target) allows you to lock on and fire missiles.  The space bar key will cause your ship to do a barrel roll.<br /><br />1) There is a vendor in the Republic Fleet station that sells "grade 1" upgrades for your spaceship.  At a minimum for this mission, you should purchase the larger missile load (40 missiles instead of 16) and any upgrades that boost your damage (faster fire, more damage, etc).<br /><br />2) Save your missiles for the turrets on the Empire's star destroyers.  While it's not crucial that you blow up turrets on the destroyers, it's good XP until you run out of missiles.  On other missions, you'll need to conserve your missiles for specific targets and not waste them on enemy fighters.  Your remaining missile count appears in the lower right corner of the screen.  <br /><br />3) Try not to shoot the vessel that you are escorting.<br /><br />4) Until Bioware rebalances early space combat, there's no reason not to just tape down the fire button (left mouse) during this mission.  Your ship will automatically fire as fast as possible at whatever you point at.  Just keep the crosshairs away from the ship that you are escorting or friendly ships / fighters.<br /><br />5) The secret to the Fondor Esort is to focus your fire on every single enemy fighter that you come across.  Since they are weak ships, it will only take you a few rounds to kill each one.  In other missions, you'll sometimes run across "elite" enemy fighters which will require a lot more rounds (or a missile) in order to destroy.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SyYdiicswxA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
