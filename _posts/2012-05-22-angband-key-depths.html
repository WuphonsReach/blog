One of the key bits of knowledge that you gain after playing Angband for a while is learning when you are too deep compared to your equipment / character level / skill.&nbsp; At least, if you don't want to suffer from "it breathes... you die" situations. <br /><br />From the old Angband FAQ (<a href="http://www.phial.com/angband/angfaq1.html">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.phial.com/angband/angfaq2.html">part 2</a>) which was written for Angband 2.8.3:<br /><ul><li>1000' - Free Action (paralyze), See Invisible (ghosts, invisible critters)</li><li>1500' - Fire/Cold/Acid/Lightning Resists (the basic 4 resists)</li><li>2000' - Poison/Nether Resists, Hold Life</li></ul>Below 1000' and you start running into very nasty critters who can paralyze you or are invisible.&nbsp; The dragons and other things which breath the basic four damage types start showing up around 1500'.&nbsp; When you get below 2000' you start running into Drolems with nasty poison attacks along with things that breath/cast nether spells.&nbsp; The undead below 2000' also like to drain your XP.<br /><br />Things changed a bit in the 3.0 series and even more in 3.1-3.3.&nbsp; More current recommendations are that you should have the following before descending below these levels:<br /><ul><li>1000' - Free Action (paralyze), See Invisible (ghosts, invisible critters)<br /></li><li>1500' - Fire/Cold/Acid/Lightning Resists (the basic 4 resists)</li><li>2000' - Poison/Nether Resists, Hold Life</li><li>???? - Speed of +10 (permanent or temporary)</li><li>???? - Speed of +20 (permanent or temporary) </li></ul>Adjust based on your risk attitude and what character you are playing.&nbsp; Some of the monsters below certain depths can one-shot kill you without the proper resists.&nbsp; Some monsters can be easily avoided, others you will run the risk of senseless depth without some form of monster detection (such as telepathy or checking for monsters every 20-40 steps).
