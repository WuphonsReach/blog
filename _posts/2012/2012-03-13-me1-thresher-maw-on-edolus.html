Thresher Maw combat on Edolus.  Since I've never seen one before, it took me a few tries to get it killed.  I even got double-XP for killing it for some reason.<br /><br /><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/prJVv1q4A9I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Note that if you can get away from the Thresher Maw, such as up on a hill, you can press the [F] key on the PC to repair the Mako.  It takes 20 seconds or so to fully repair and uses up a bunch of omni-gel.
