The <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Main_Page">latest version</a> of Dwarf Fortress is out and there's been a <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">lot of work</a> on the "fortress" mode in the past few months (after a long focus on the "adventure" mode).&nbsp; There's also a<a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=59026.msg1319616#msg1319616"> new version of the "newbie" pack</a> which <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=59026.msg3353159#msg3353159">includes everything except the Mayday tileset and the DFHack utilities</a> (but there are <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=59026.msg3353179#msg3353179">ways to get DFHack to work with 34.11</a>).<br /><br /><br />
