One of the things that I'm constantly having to redo in each new fortress is setup uniforms for my dwarves.&nbsp; Things have changed a bit over the years, so this is for 34.11.&nbsp; You should define your uniforms before creating any squads (it's just easier that way).<br /><br />To get to the uniform creation: [m][n] - Military uniforms screen, then [c] to create a new uniform and [N] to name it.<br /><br /><strong>Militia Basic</strong> - The basic militia uniform is simply crossbow + buckler that goes "over" clothing [r]&nbsp;and requires "exact" matches [m].&nbsp; The idea here is that you create enough quivers, bolts, crossbows and bolts and shove your civilians into squads of 10 dwarves, but leave their schedule set to inactive/none year-round.&nbsp; What will happen is that if any enemies show up while the dwarves are working, they will immediately unleash a volley of crossbow bolts at the enemy.&nbsp; It won't be accurate fire, but 5-10 dwarves all shooting at something has good odds of killing a solo thief / snatcher.<br /><br />Ammo for the basic civilian militia should be set to 300 bone bolts and 300 wooden bolts.&nbsp; Don't waste metal ammo on your unskilled dwarves unless you are swimming in 3000+ bolts in your stockpiles.&nbsp; Don't setup archery ranges unless you are willing to assign 500 bone and 500 wood bolts to each squad of 10 dwarves.&nbsp; Even when set to inactive/none on the schedule, you will find that your dwarves slack off from their normal duties to go to the archery range.&nbsp; So only allow 1 archery target per squad, which will minimize the issue.<br /><br />Crossbows for civilians are best made out of bone/wood, using your highest skilled craftdwarf.&nbsp; Quality matters for the crossbows, but material doesn't.&nbsp; The material for the buckler is not that important, unless they are running up and bashing with the buckler.&nbsp; So wood / leather / whatever will suffice to start.<br /><br />Don't forget to make or buy enough quivers.<br /><br />Flasks / waterskins are useful additions so the dwarves can carry around alcohol.&nbsp; Backpacks are not useful and any militia squads should have their supplies [u] set to "Do not carry food".<br /><br /><strong>Militia Intermediate</strong> - If you have a metal industry up and running, you can add a few metal items to go "over" their existing clothing. The metal type should be whatever armor metal you have lots of.&nbsp; Steel is preferred, then iron / bronze / copper.&nbsp; Other metals are not that great.&nbsp;You want to keep the weight down so that the dwarves aren't slowed down.<br /><br />- Crossbow (any, wood/bone are about weight 1, steel is 3)<br />- Iron Buckler (weight 8, shields are 10, bucklers are better for crossbows)<br />- Iron Mail Shirt (weight 19, optional due to weight)<br />- Iron Helm (weight 7)<br />- Iron Gauntlets (weight 1 each)<br />- Iron High/Low Boots (weight 3 each) <br />&nbsp; <br />At this point I start considering using silver / copper / iron bolts if I have a surplus of a particular metal.&nbsp; These squads will still use wood/bone bolts as well. <br />&nbsp; <br /><strong>Militia Advanced</strong> - Once your dwarves have trained up armor, or if you have dwarves "strong" or "very strong" characteristics, then you can assign them to a more advanced squad.&nbsp; This is a better uniform, with better protection (almost a full armor set).&nbsp;&nbsp;I usually also have a lot of leather, so I force one of the cloaks/hoods to be leather.<br /><br />Greaves and breastplates&nbsp;are very heavy, so are the iron chain leggings.&nbsp; You should probably skip those three unless you have very strong, very well trained armor users in your militia.<br /><br />- iron breastplate (shaped, heavy, should be skipped)<br />- iron mail shirt<br />- leather tunic<br />- leather cloak<br />- cloak (any, you could have up to 6 cloaks total, but 2 is plenty, 3-4 for front line troops)<br />- iron helm (shaped)<br />- leather hood<br />- hood (any, you can have multiple hoods, 2 is plenty, 3-4 for front line troops)<br />- iron greaves (shaped, heavy,&nbsp;should be skipped)<br />- leather trousers<br />- iron gauntlets (shaped)<br />- leather gloves<br />- leather mittens<br />- iron high/low boots (shaped)<br />- socks<br />- iron buckler<br />- crossbow<br /><br />Because that is a full set of armor, you can set it to "replace" their existing clothing without worrying about unhappy dwarves due to nakedess.
