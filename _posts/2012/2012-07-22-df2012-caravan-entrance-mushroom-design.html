Just a quick explanation of a design that I use in Dwarf Fortress for caravans.&nbsp; It consists of a 5-tile wide paved road inside of a 7-tile wide walled area in the shape of a mushroom / mirrored u-bend.&nbsp; Caravan wagons need at least a 3-tile wide entrance, but you should allow 7-tiles so that simultaneous incoming / outgoing caravans don't pile up in a traffic jam.<br /><br />Enemies in Dwarf Fortress will almost always make a beeline for your dinining room / trade depot area and will take the shortest route.&nbsp; Because the caravan entrance is longer then getting to the side entrance, very few enemies will take the untrapped and mostly unguarded caravan route.&nbsp; Still, you should have at least one drawbridge / retracting bridge that you can use to close off the caravan entrance.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/2012/20120721/DF2012-Alathorrun-CaravanEntrance-MushroomDesign-Annotated.jpg"><img src="http://www.wuphonsreach.org/Games/DwarfFortress/2012/20120721/thumbs640/DF2012-Alathorrun-CaravanEntrance-MushroomDesign-Annotated.jpg" /></a>
