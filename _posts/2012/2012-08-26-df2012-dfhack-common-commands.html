<a href="https://github.com/peterix/dfhack/" target="_blank">DFHack - Common Commands</a><br /><br />1) autonestbox - Use this after defining a bunch of 1x1 pasture zones (n) over constructed nest boxes.  It will automatically assign any not-yet-pastured, tame, non-grazer, female egg-layers to the empty pasture zones.  It will also tell you whether you need more nestboxes / pasture zones.<br /><br />2) copystock - Copies the stockpile settings under the cursor, allowing you to quickly duplicate a particular stockpile to another location. <br /><br />&nbsp;3) autobutcher - This one I'm starting to fall in love with.  Tired of bird-splosion because the eggs weren't retrieved in time?<br /><br />For poultry, I prefer to set it to (15) female young, (15) male young, (10) female adults, (5) male adults.&nbsp; That gives me the upper limit on egg production from the domesticated species. &nbsp;If you need more egg production, increase the number of female adults (3rd number) to 15 or 20.<br /><br />autobutcher target 15 15 10 5 BIRD_CHICKEN<br />autobutcher target&nbsp;15 15 10 5&nbsp;BIRD_DUCK<br />autobutcher target&nbsp;15 15 10 5&nbsp;BIRD_GUINEAFOWL<br />autobutcher target&nbsp;15 15 10 5&nbsp;BIRD_PEAFOWL_BLUE<br />autobutcher target&nbsp;15 15 10 5&nbsp;BIRD_GOOSE<br />autobutcher target&nbsp;15 15 10 5&nbsp;BIRD_TURKEY<br />autobutcher watch BIRD_CHICKEN BIRD_DUCK BIRD_GUINEAFOWL BIRD_GOOSE BIRD_PEAFOWL_BLUE BIRD_TURKEY<br /><br />Note: 60 egg-layers can easily feed a fortress of 120-150 dwarves with lavish meals for years.<br /><br />For pigs, I create a very large room (about 15x15) somewhere underground and use:<br /><br />autobutcher target 30 30 20 5 PIG<br />autobutcher watch PIG<br /><br />Dogs:<br /><br />autobutcher target 15 15 25 10 DOG<br />autobutcher watch DOG<br /><br />&nbsp;Cats:<br /><br />autobutcher target 10 10 10 5 CAT<br />autobutcher watch CAT <br /><br />Remember to issue a "autobutcher start" once you are done setting up the targets and adding animals to the watch list.&nbsp; See also "autobutcher list".&nbsp; If you've had an explosion of a particular species, start with 50/50/50/50, then work your way down 10 at a time until you get to your target number.<br /><br />4) prospect all - Useful prior to embark to estimate whether there are metals or stones of the desired type.&nbsp; Also useful post-embark to get a detailed listing of what is actually at the embark site. <br /><br />5) showmood - A bit spoilerish, but it doesn't show you too much more then what you could figure out in-game.<br /><br />6) zone - Allows you to assign livestock to pasture zones automatically based on various filters.&nbsp; A bit tricky to use, but the key points to remember are:<br /><br />- Create a pasture/pen zone in-game.<br />- Use the (i) command in-game to highlight it<br />- In DFHack, issue a "zone set" command to select it.<br />- Now you can do "zone assign" commands.<br /><br />Putting all male egglayers in a pasture zone.<br /><br />zone set<br />zone assign all own unassigned male egglayer not grazer<br /><br />Or if you want to only do turkeys, or just the male poults:<br /><br />zone set<br />zone assign all own unassigned male maxage 2 race BIRD_TURKEY<br /><br />Note: &nbsp;This post was updated in Oct 2014 and works fine with DF2014 (v0.40.13).
