A new release of Dwarf Fortress (40.13, a.k.a. 0.40.13, a.k.a. DF2014) is out and is stable enough that it is work mucking around with. &nbsp;I always suggest one of the Lazy Newbie Packs (LNPs) and <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076" target="_blank">PeridexisErrant has the best one currently for Windows</a>.<br /><br />One of the first things I do on a new DF is edit the "init.txt" to change the font size to be something more readable on large screens. &nbsp;The following will use the larger rectangular font that ships with the game and makes the initial window a good bit larger.<br /><br />[WINDOWEDX:80]<br />[WINDOWEDY:80]<br />[FONT:curses_800x600.png]<br /><div><br /></div><div>Note, I often switch between normal and maximized window sizes depending on what I am trying to do. &nbsp;When reading dwarf thoughts working in a narrow, but tall, window is easiest. &nbsp;When looking at the map, a maximized window is easier to deal with.</div><div><br /></div><div>Suggestions for the "Options" tab in the launcher. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>[POPULATION_CAP:25] - Early in a fort's life, you don't want a huge wave of migrants, so setting the Population Cap to be something in the 25-50 range will keep things manageable for the first few years. &nbsp;Once the fort has matured a bit, I increment this number upwards by 25-50 per year.</div><div><br /></div><div>[BABY_CHILD_CAP:50:25] - Limits you to no more then 50 children or 25% of the fort's population. &nbsp;This option only prevents pregnancies from starting.</div><div><br /></div><div>I suggest making sure that the following things are set on the "Settings" tab in the launcher. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>[FPS_CAP:30] - The FPS setting slow things down at the start so that you have time to react.</div><div><br /></div><br /><hr /><br />Once you have generated a world, you can browse the legends or embark.<br /><br /><br />
