It is the 400th year since history began in&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.wuphonsreach.org/2014/09/df2014-teyo-oroni-world-of-omen.html" target="_blank">Teyo Oroni, The World of Omen</a>. We, the dwarves of Spear of Boards number only 424 and our king, Mistem Pagescorched, has decreed that a new settlement be established in a safe location, somewhere hopefully safe from the creatures from before time began. <br /><br />The list of fallen settlements is numerous.<br /><br />Cudgelkiss - Founded in year 5, destroyed the same year by&nbsp;the colossus bronze Swifteagle the Banner of Influence. &nbsp;Swifteagle was finally destroyed in 158 by the elves at Even Frost.<br /><br />Angelguilds - Founded in year 1, destroyed in year 21&nbsp;by the forgotten beast Rofa Sunkwaste the Abyss of Pulps. &nbsp;Nobody, not even our best scouts, has returned from Angelguilds in almost 400 years.<br /><br />Cudgelkiss - Reclaimed in year 18, destroyed again&nbsp;year in 28 by the colossus bronze Mugub Clobberhero the Willful Assaults. &nbsp;Mugub was killed in 47 by the humans when it attempted to attack Metamber.<br /><br />Thinconstruct - Founded in 26, destroyed in 36 by the forgotten beast Slevina Veiledwitch. &nbsp;As with Angelguilds, nobody has returned from there in nearly 400 years.<br /><br />Gemcombines - Founded in year 1, destroyed in year 68&nbsp;by the dragon Ertal Flickeredsweltered the Golden Heat<b>.</b>&nbsp; Ertal was struck down by the dwarf, X, in 172 at Wheelriddle (another dwarven civ's site). This site may be one for the more adventurous to explore and reclaim.<br /><br />The list of surviving settlements is few. &nbsp;All of the settlements are cursed by beast attacks.<br /><br />Laborgilt - Founded in year 2.<br /><br />Workchannel - Founded in year 54. &nbsp;The current seat of the high king Mistem.<br /><br />Goalpage - Founded in year 55. <br /><br /><br />
