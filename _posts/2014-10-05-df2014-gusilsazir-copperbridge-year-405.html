This should be a quiet year. &nbsp;The goal is to finish digging out and smoothing the residences enough that every dwarf has their own bedroom. &nbsp;Population cap is going to be raised to 80 now that bedrooms are being created quickly.<br /><br />As a result of the last visit by the liaison, we have been promoted to a duchy. &nbsp;Our baron 'Broker' Itdunkogan is now requiring more lavish rooms. &nbsp;It should be enough to just place masterwork furniture to match his increased needs, but may also require engraving the floor / walls of his rooms in order to bring it up in value. &nbsp;While I do have some artifact furniture, I refuse to use it on the duke/baron because I am saving it for the eventual arrival of a king or queen.<br /><br />Masterpiece engravings on a 5x5 room filled with a handful of masterwork stone furniture item easily gets you to the 2500+ value tier (Grand Bedroom / Dining Room / Mausoleum, Opulent Throne Room). &nbsp;To get to the 10,000+ value tier, you will need a lot more furniture or decorated and encrusted furniture. &nbsp;Or a larger room that has been engraved by a high skill engraver.<br /><br />The mayor, Vucar Athelbecor, is also requiring more lavish chambers.<br /><br />27th Granite - Tun Ngalakonos and Tosid Vucartastrod are now married, as are Stakud Avuztosed and Eral Lelumnish. &nbsp;The captain of the guard, Udib Kudustnish is married to Lokum Dalzatasmel. &nbsp;Miner Atisadas is a lover of Doc Geshudbetan. &nbsp;That means three married couples and one pair of lovers. &nbsp;No other significant relationships in the fort.<br /><br />Meng Thocitadil is still collecting pets and how has four cats as pets.<br /><br />The baron has handed down a 26-day prison sentence for our leatherworker, Cog Edemost, due to not meeting the production order of rings. <br /><br />I have made sure to construct chains (under 'v' restraints) in some of the 2x3 bedrooms in the residence level. &nbsp;Each 2x3 room has a bed, 2 squares of food and 2 squares of drink. All within reach of the chain. &nbsp;I may eventually knock out the walls between the cells and put a table/chair/statue in those 3 cells. &nbsp;Once those six starter cells were constructed and assigned for justice (q-r-j), then I assigned a captain of the guard to administer justice.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-17nHNQWkD1w/VDF8pldSJjI/AAAAAAAAAgo/ZueDypCiPMQ/s1600/02-JailCellsZ30.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-17nHNQWkD1w/VDF8pldSJjI/AAAAAAAAAgo/ZueDypCiPMQ/s1600/02-JailCellsZ30.png" height="320" width="314" /></a></div><br /><br />2nd Slate - Cog Edemost begins serving sentence. &nbsp;Even without the table/chair, the masterwork glass windows, the masterwork bed both result in good thoughts.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wHKa9_XUWtY/VDF8xfHg0xI/AAAAAAAAAgw/xwfqv0ll-d8/s1600/02-CogEdemost-Thoughts.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wHKa9_XUWtY/VDF8xfHg0xI/AAAAAAAAAgw/xwfqv0ll-d8/s1600/02-CogEdemost-Thoughts.png" height="235" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />To be safe against beatings, I will eventually need about 24 jail cells, although 12 might be enough if mandates are always met.<br /><br />7th Slate - More migrants arrive. This was a pretty big wave with 15 dwarves suddenly arriving on our doorstep. &nbsp;Given the amount of wood and stone hauling to be done, it will keep them busy for a year or two.<br /><br />17th Slate - Cog is only doing so-so in confinement.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x-imE42r3o8/VDGA_McxgwI/AAAAAAAAAg8/dvnYcFxJsU0/s1600/02-CogEdemost-17thSlate.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x-imE42r3o8/VDGA_McxgwI/AAAAAAAAAg8/dvnYcFxJsU0/s1600/02-CogEdemost-17thSlate.png" height="39" width="320" /></a></div><br />The embarrassed to be uncovered thought was interesting. &nbsp;This is likely because I just ran DFHack's "cleanowned scattered X" command which resulted in his gloves and shoes being confiscated due to having a wear level of "X" or "XX". &nbsp;It's more likely that the missing shoes are the issue, rather then the gloves.<br /><br />Here is perhaps a better designed jail cell that holds two prisoners. &nbsp;The table/chair in the middle is shared by both. &nbsp;Each have their own bed and own stockpiles of food/drink. &nbsp;The glass windows are masterworks and look out into the open area so that the jails on the opposite side can be seen.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U2uOnym-TsA/VDGEBegcw1I/AAAAAAAAAhI/JTI4FEi8HBU/s1600/02-JailCells-Double.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U2uOnym-TsA/VDGEBegcw1I/AAAAAAAAAhI/JTI4FEi8HBU/s1600/02-JailCells-Double.png" /></a></div><br />21st Felsite - Cog has been released from jail and is back to churning out leather clothing and bags.<br /><br />1st Galena - Era Lelumnish gives birth to a baby girl. &nbsp;Lokum Dalzatasmel gives birth to a baby boy.<br /><br />1st Limestone - A selection of turkey hens, guineahens, blue peahens, and geese have been locked away on nest boxes, deep within the fort. &nbsp;Hopefully by spring their eggs will hatch resulting in more egg layers.<br /><br />13th Sandstone - A new couple has been spotted in the fortress, Mebzuth Fikukcerol and Ilral Guisilnecik.<br /><br />1st Timber - The captain of the guard has a secretive mood. &nbsp;He also moves about three times slower then any other dwarf, possibly because he is wearing steel greaves, high boots, mail shirt, breastplate, gauntlets and a helm. &nbsp;I specifically chose him due to being "very weak" and below average endurance.<br /><br />7th Opal - Mebzuth Fikukcerol gives birth to a baby girl. &nbsp;Fortress population at 82 dwarves.
