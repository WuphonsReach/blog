1st Granite - 26 dwarves (3 are children) plus the 7 were-dwarves.<br /><br />21st Malachite - First birth in the fortress. &nbsp;Rovod Uzoltad gives birth to a baby girl. &nbsp;The father is Minkot Kelziril.<br /><br />27th Malachite - Eight migrants arrive.<br /><br />23rd Galena - One of the miners broke through a barrier and unleashed the aquifer onto floor Z92. &nbsp;Due to a lack of doors and hatch covers, this is threatening to flood most of Z90 and Z91. &nbsp;Fortunately, there were hatch covers installed across the entirety of Z90, plus doors, which limits the potential damage.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-63Pmbb_Enmw/VDpvcIj7gdI/AAAAAAAAAsk/vRhhPOdkKRI/s1600/06-FloodingOnZ92.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-63Pmbb_Enmw/VDpvcIj7gdI/AAAAAAAAAsk/vRhhPOdkKRI/s1600/06-FloodingOnZ92.png" height="253" width="320" /></a></div><br />Trying to get screw pumps setup on Z93 to unflood the area.<br /><br />15th Limestone - Caravan has arrived along with liaison Dastot Degstakud from Thob Lelum.<br /><br />22nd Limestone - Flooding has been contained as best as possible. &nbsp;The upper floor is shown first. &nbsp;The middle floor (not shown) only had the stairway flooded out. &nbsp;The bottom floor (shown second) was not as much of a disaster due to getting doors/walls up on the north stair before it flooded out.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wsmDIRZA6jg/VDp21WsgfLI/AAAAAAAAAs0/x9SN21KsYuM/s1600/06-ContainedZ92.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wsmDIRZA6jg/VDp21WsgfLI/AAAAAAAAAs0/x9SN21KsYuM/s1600/06-ContainedZ92.png" height="188" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xznFFWOrtRg/VDp21QktO3I/AAAAAAAAAs4/4pi6o22ZvIM/s1600/06-FloodingOnZ90.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xznFFWOrtRg/VDp21QktO3I/AAAAAAAAAs4/4pi6o22ZvIM/s1600/06-FloodingOnZ90.png" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br />Now I have to figure out how to pump all this water out (probably into a cistern).<br /><br />17th Sandstone - Three more migrants. &nbsp;There are now (40) dwarves (3 children, 1 baby) plus the (7) were-dwarves.<br /><br />I think it might be possible to use the flooding to drown my were-dwarves...<br /><br />13th Timber - Muthkat Ekirsazir gives birth to a baby boy. &nbsp;Her husband is Tobul Ularducim.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
