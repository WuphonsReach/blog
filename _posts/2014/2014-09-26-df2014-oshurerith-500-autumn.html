It is the first of Limestone 500, the start of Autumn here in Oshurerith (Circlelabored). &nbsp;We are thirteen beards in strength and the fortress construction proceeds apace. &nbsp;None of the local wildlife has caused issues, nor have we had any invaders. &nbsp;A dedicated bookkeeper has been assigned and he tells us we have:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nxtoZbf2-Ko/VCWFs0reqMI/AAAAAAAAALo/MlBJS5DQ28k/s1600/0500-Stocks-EarlyAutumn.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nxtoZbf2-Ko/VCWFs0reqMI/AAAAAAAAALo/MlBJS5DQ28k/s1600/0500-Stocks-EarlyAutumn.png" height="114" width="320" /></a></div><br />One of the horses has been butchered, and most of the meats that we brought along have been cooked into biscuits. &nbsp;The other horse will be butchered after the trade caravan has been dealt with.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ab8wvPnzGvE/VCWF879KA-I/AAAAAAAAALw/yCjLZFmHhzY/s1600/0500-PreparedMeals-Autumn.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ab8wvPnzGvE/VCWF879KA-I/AAAAAAAAALw/yCjLZFmHhzY/s1600/0500-PreparedMeals-Autumn.png" height="182" width="320" /></a></div><br />Construction has started on the courtyard wall, as well as enclosing the caravan entrance with walls, ceiling and drawbridge.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eTXxTmlH210/VCWGkQ8mGAI/AAAAAAAAAL8/dc6WSuhj_fY/s1600/0500-Autumn-SurfaceMap-Stonesense.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eTXxTmlH210/VCWGkQ8mGAI/AAAAAAAAAL8/dc6WSuhj_fY/s1600/0500-Autumn-SurfaceMap-Stonesense.png" height="200" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JrMgF2WBT0c/VCWGkSbXFkI/AAAAAAAAAL4/98IT5V2c1DA/s1600/0500-Autumn-SurfaceMap.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JrMgF2WBT0c/VCWGkSbXFkI/AAAAAAAAAL4/98IT5V2c1DA/s1600/0500-Autumn-SurfaceMap.png" height="214" width="320" /></a></div><br />Since the caravan drawbridges have been hooked up to levers, we have constructed the trade depot inside and linked that area to the main stairwell.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2OFWoRvJ92Q/VCWHEO6pg7I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/W-2qusmBK3o/s1600/0500-Autumn-TradeDepot-Stonesense.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2OFWoRvJ92Q/VCWHEO6pg7I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/W-2qusmBK3o/s1600/0500-Autumn-TradeDepot-Stonesense.png" height="189" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SyLeo9kMWzw/VCWHD--ZjgI/AAAAAAAAAMM/M5M6hQWBHGI/s1600/0500-Autumn-TradeDepot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SyLeo9kMWzw/VCWHD--ZjgI/AAAAAAAAAMM/M5M6hQWBHGI/s1600/0500-Autumn-TradeDepot.png" height="320" width="161" /></a></div><br />The location of the trade depot is only temporary, we have already started construction of the ramp that leads down to the north, then bends east and will eventually open out into a much larger area which can support stockpiles, mine carts, tracks, and other infrastructure needed to get 1000+ items to the trade depot within a two week window.<br /><br />At the moment, we are waiting for the trade caravan to arrive within the next few weeks. &nbsp;Our mechanics are still making mechanisms for trade and we have also been making rock crafts. &nbsp;Most things which were in the wagon are now safely stored below ground.
