A season has passed since we settled by the stream in the Forest of Charity. &nbsp;The first migrant wave brought 6 dwarves, bringing our total beard count up to 13. &nbsp;They have all been put to work at various tasks.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-agx_QlFMjSs/VCWAUCl6B9I/AAAAAAAAAK0/KDkbAVtQtHo/s1600/0500-StartOfSummer-Surface.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-agx_QlFMjSs/VCWAUCl6B9I/AAAAAAAAAK0/KDkbAVtQtHo/s1600/0500-StartOfSummer-Surface.png" height="245" width="320" /></a></div><br />The mechanic shop has been running non-stop making gears for the trade caravan. &nbsp;The carpenter has started production of barrels, bins, wheelbarrows and beds. &nbsp;The mason has been making doors, hatch covers and stone blocks.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aOPB6J5sWeA/VCWA4tfcfBI/AAAAAAAAAK8/1zsGH4tFA3M/s1600/0500-Z121-MasonWorkshopWithSleepingArea.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aOPB6J5sWeA/VCWA4tfcfBI/AAAAAAAAAK8/1zsGH4tFA3M/s1600/0500-Z121-MasonWorkshopWithSleepingArea.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aGGp5EJhH3U/VCWDP2j1AsI/AAAAAAAAALc/ZjDSKfmrQ4E/s1600/0500-Z121-MasonWorkshopWithSleepingArea-Stonesense.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aGGp5EJhH3U/VCWDP2j1AsI/AAAAAAAAALc/ZjDSKfmrQ4E/s1600/0500-Z121-MasonWorkshopWithSleepingArea-Stonesense.png" height="181" width="320" /></a></div><br />The primary layout of the fortress is a 3x3 stairway with a column in the center, with a set of 3x6 rooms on the south side and the 11x11 skylit area on the west side. &nbsp;That 11x11 area will eventually have constructed floors from top to bottom and will be used for refuse piles, meeting areas, and anything else that should be exposed to sunlight.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hy-4ywfvb4c/VCWBGgH3X8I/AAAAAAAAALE/FbGH9ytgYyQ/s1600/0500-Z132-ChannelingOfSkylight.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hy-4ywfvb4c/VCWBGgH3X8I/AAAAAAAAALE/FbGH9ytgYyQ/s1600/0500-Z132-ChannelingOfSkylight.png" /></a></div><br />The 3x6 rooms will eventually be turned into storage / bedrooms / offices / dormitories. &nbsp;But during the first season, I needed a series of rooms that could hold workshops, small stockpiles, a few beds, and animal pens / nest boxes. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fw_Vcp6Wh2E/VCWC9Si2a_I/AAAAAAAAALU/PD-yMlAJeVM/s1600/0500-NestingArea.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fw_Vcp6Wh2E/VCWC9Si2a_I/AAAAAAAAALU/PD-yMlAJeVM/s1600/0500-NestingArea.png" height="216" width="320" /></a></div><br />The top of the 3x3 stair shaft is a little box of a building with a roof and a 3x3 drawbridge acting as the eastern wall. &nbsp;It is already hooked up to a lever that can be pulled in an emergency to seal off the fortress from the outside. &nbsp;While not outstanding, it does the job for now.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqHrp0WhMEU/VCWCNiy5M3I/AAAAAAAAALM/f3SYSfZQ8j4/s1600/0500-SurfaceStonesense-EntranceWithDrawbridge-StartOfSecondEntrance.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eqHrp0WhMEU/VCWCNiy5M3I/AAAAAAAAALM/f3SYSfZQ8j4/s1600/0500-SurfaceStonesense-EntranceWithDrawbridge-StartOfSecondEntrance.png" height="192" width="320" /></a></div><br />The miners have also started to channel out the main caravan entrance and bridge to the northeast of the current stair shaft. &nbsp;The drawbridge will act as the outer defense leading into a covered building and a ramp that leads down into the stone layers.<br /><br />We have enough drink for now, about 100 worth, but only 20 prepared meals. &nbsp;It will be time to start cooking eggs and butchering the horses that pulled the cart soon.
