Spring has sprung. &nbsp;The courtyard wall is complete. &nbsp;And the surface refuse area has been walled in and a line of traps installed in the corridor leading to it. &nbsp;I still need to put a roof over the refuse area to make it necromancer-proof, but it is now a bit more secure then it was before.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yJeRn7yqFxI/VCW-1xJrYaI/AAAAAAAAANc/gP3tlESFhjg/s1600/0501-Spring-Stocks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yJeRn7yqFxI/VCW-1xJrYaI/AAAAAAAAANc/gP3tlESFhjg/s1600/0501-Spring-Stocks.png" height="117" width="320" /></a></div><br />One of the issues that I am having with drink is that I only have plump helmets and sweet pods to brew from. &nbsp;Cave wheat is a "grain" alcohol due to the bug-fix mod that I installed, and brewing of grains results in no seeds (you have to "thresh" the plant to get seeds). &nbsp;I did expand the farms a bit, and the sole farmer has no other jobs assigned.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYb1zkhlrMY/VCW_sWVnTAI/AAAAAAAAANk/5S0LdT9AGXI/s1600/0501-Spring-Z132-ExpandedFarms.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYb1zkhlrMY/VCW_sWVnTAI/AAAAAAAAANk/5S0LdT9AGXI/s1600/0501-Spring-Z132-ExpandedFarms.png" height="235" width="320" /></a></div><br />Soon I will need to start training up a new farmer to help / replace the existing one. &nbsp;My original farmer (Athelnomal) had a strange mood and is now a legendary stonecrafter.<br /><br />A look at the current job assignments (using DFHack's nifty UI). &nbsp;I have started to specialize a bit.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KQQ8okSOENw/VCXAG0-XuII/AAAAAAAAANs/uzidZtmJbhc/s1600/0501-Spring-DFHack-Labors.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KQQ8okSOENw/VCXAG0-XuII/AAAAAAAAANs/uzidZtmJbhc/s1600/0501-Spring-DFHack-Labors.png" height="84" width="320" /></a></div><br />Also, 'Doc' Ledudib and 'Books' Mengamem got married over the winter season, that is why their happiness score is so high.<br /><br />Plans for the spring is to finish reworking the butcher / tannery / kitchen area, and figure out what I need to do to fix the alcohol situation before it gets worse. &nbsp;I may possibly find some surface crops that can be farmed.<br /><br />I also need to setup more dormatories, bedrooms, and finish the skylit shaft so that I can smooth and engrave the bottom floor and use that as the dining / meeting area.<br /><br />Update: Elven caravan arrived on 14th Granite, 501. &nbsp;They didn't bring much of use, so I bought out all of their cages, wooden weapons, barrels, buckets, splints and crutches (only 750 urists worth) and sent them on their way with a 2000 urist profit. &nbsp;Hopefully they will come back next year with a lot more pack animals along with cloth.<br /><br />Update #2: Kol Dodokmedtob has given birth to Nil Avuzshameb. &nbsp;Kol is married to Logem Gusilzefon. &nbsp;Kol's grandparents also migrated to the fortress.<br /><br />Update #3: 'Cook' Eddudalath has given birth to Muthkat Evudoltar. &nbsp;She is married to 'Brewer' Lorbamerith.
