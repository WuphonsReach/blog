The human caravan arrived approximately on-time, entering the map on the 13th of Hematite in early summer. &nbsp;Three more migrants have arrived from the mountain homes. &nbsp;Work has started on the cistern and we will pump water from the stream in order to fill it before sealing it back off.<br /><br />24th Hematite - Udil Siguningul has given birth to a boy, we now have three children in the fort.<br /><br />30th Hematite - Finished trading with the human caravan. &nbsp;We did not produce enough trade goods to enable us to purchase the bins full of cloth that they brought. &nbsp;For next year, we will need to increase production of high value goods.<br /><br />13th Malachite - Surface farms for Prickle Berries, Rat Weed and Rope Reeds have been started.<br /><br />1st Limestone - Start of Autumn in the fortress. &nbsp;Drink stocks are now at 923 units, with 924 prepared meals. &nbsp;The dwarven caravan should arrive in about two weeks and we are in mostly good shape. &nbsp;The glassworks have been creating large serrated green glass discs from sand and charcoal, the legendary stonecrafter has been turning out stone trinkets at a good clip, and we have a handful of mechanisms to trade.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gTW5gmBR_KA/VCYrugRGF1I/AAAAAAAAAN8/vYdogH2SdBY/s1600/501-1Limestone-Stocks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gTW5gmBR_KA/VCYrugRGF1I/AAAAAAAAAN8/vYdogH2SdBY/s1600/501-1Limestone-Stocks.png" height="118" width="320" /></a></div><br />Dedicated or very high skill dwarves: (2) engravers, (3) miners, (1) stonecrafter, (2) farmers, (1) cook, (1) brewer, (2) masons. The rest of the dwarves are generalists, haulers, or fill-ins on various tasks. &nbsp;Most of the dwarves are content, but a lot of them are starting to want their own assigned bedrooms.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7MyD79qh39M/VCYsNnYdknI/AAAAAAAAAOE/y_PS2M9oZmw/s1600/501-1Limestone-Labors.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7MyD79qh39M/VCYsNnYdknI/AAAAAAAAAOE/y_PS2M9oZmw/s1600/501-1Limestone-Labors.png" height="98" width="320" /></a></div><br />One female from each species of bird (turkey hen, goose, peahen) are locked away behind closed doors in hopes that the eggs will hatch.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVDeTsxNy1A/VCauklzMJaI/AAAAAAAAAOc/wbMKNNhHG80/s1600/0502-BrewerBecomesTheBaronOfUnionstake.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVDeTsxNy1A/VCauklzMJaI/AAAAAAAAAOc/wbMKNNhHG80/s1600/0502-BrewerBecomesTheBaronOfUnionstake.png" height="130" width="320" /></a></div><br />Apparently, 'Brewer' Sandardlabor (Lorbamerith) had noble relatives in Unionsstake, who have passed away. &nbsp;That means I now have a noble with demands to deal with, along with his wife ('Cook' Eddudalath) the consort of the baron.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
