3rd of Granite, 502 - Spring has arrived and along with it the expectation of elves. &nbsp;The diplomat snuck onto the map and issued a warning to the barroness Eddudalath. &nbsp;Probably because we have been cutting down all of the trees inside and outside of the courtyard to keep them from attacking us.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-037Qcdnp5aA/VCcWRDyKPRI/AAAAAAAAARE/ZKMQ81Aep-I/s1600/0502-07-Limestone1st-Stocks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-037Qcdnp5aA/VCcWRDyKPRI/AAAAAAAAARE/ZKMQ81Aep-I/s1600/0502-07-Limestone1st-Stocks.png" height="116" width="320" /></a></div><br />The dwarven caravan should be here in about ten days. &nbsp;Now is the time to make sure that all salable goods are in stockpiles near the depot as well as making any last minute items. &nbsp;Since I have a stockpile by the depot designed for non-metallic clothing, this is a good time to do "cleanowned scattered x" in DFHack, which will confiscate all worn clothing and make it eligible to be put into a stockpile instead of being scattered around the fort.<br /><br />Note to self: After using the "cleanowned" command, all of the old socks end up in the garbage dump zone location. &nbsp;They will need to be reclaimed with (d)(b)(c) before being hauled to the Trade Depot.<br /><br />12th Limestone - Dwarven caravan has entered our borders.<br /><br />24th Limestone - The dwarven diplomat has raised our hamlet to an official colony and Broker Kolbavast will become a barron.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
