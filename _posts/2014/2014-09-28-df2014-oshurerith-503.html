10th Granite - Elven diplomat, Dipane Derithele, has entered our borders.<br /><br />11th Granite - Elven caravan enters our borders. &nbsp;I have given orders that all green glass serrated discs and stone earrings and stone rings be brought to the trade depot. &nbsp;We have hidden away the wooden items as we wouldn't want to offend the pretty little elves.<br /><br />15th Granite - Trading finished. &nbsp;Due to the accident with the trade depot last year, they didn't bring much. &nbsp;The broker gave them an extra 5k urists of profit as an apology and in hopes that they will bring more stuff next year.<br /><br />There is a new (old) feature (re-)introduced in DF2014. &nbsp;The elven diplomat will now talk about tree cutting again. &nbsp;Except that 100 tree fellings in DF2014 seems a bit too easy to say yes to. &nbsp;In the older versions, that was only 100 wood. &nbsp;In DF2014, that can often be 500-1000 wood if you fell 100 trees. &nbsp;So for the moment, this is an easy demand to agree to.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jWUIDMHixws/VCdohN6AuhI/AAAAAAAAATg/dh-RSfKzFLg/s1600/0503-04-SummerSurfaceTrapMaze.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jWUIDMHixws/VCdohN6AuhI/AAAAAAAAATg/dh-RSfKzFLg/s1600/0503-04-SummerSurfaceTrapMaze.png" height="229" width="320" /></a></div><br />The pits will be at least 3Z deep, possibly as much as 5Z to get into the first or second rock layer. &nbsp;I will probably sprinkle cage traps around as well. &nbsp;The goal with a trap maze is to suck them in, then make them run a fair distance in order to escape, with a high chance that they fall back in.<br /><br />I have also setup DFHack "autobutcher" for the pigs, cats and dogs in the fortress. &nbsp;I went with 10 or 20 babies of both sexes and either 10/10 or 20/5 adult females/males. &nbsp;The first two numbers are baby females and baby males. &nbsp;The last two numbers are adult females and adult males.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
