The year is 400 and we are the children of refugees from Ropes of Work, which fell about 230 years ago. &nbsp;Our ancestors have hid in the wilds and the scouts have finally returned word of a deserted island in the middle of a saltwater lake to the far south. &nbsp;Seven of us have volunteered to go there with supplies and attempt to rebuild the Ropes of Work.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ewe9Q-TKbmY/VCjSjfBxkqI/AAAAAAAAAYc/66m2ZNYPZPg/s1600/0400-01-Gusilsazir-Copperbridge.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ewe9Q-TKbmY/VCjSjfBxkqI/AAAAAAAAAYc/66m2ZNYPZPg/s1600/0400-01-Gusilsazir-Copperbridge.png" height="57" width="320" /></a></div><br />No wildlife is visible and the land is very flat with many large trees.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--XMlYL25ggE/VCjSrfjl3XI/AAAAAAAAAYk/wxNwfcFZMVs/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-EmbarkArea.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--XMlYL25ggE/VCjSrfjl3XI/AAAAAAAAAYk/wxNwfcFZMVs/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-EmbarkArea.png" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><br />First rule of survival, make sure the cook doesn't use up our seeds making meals. &nbsp;Or cook all of our alcohol into meals.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uiN8rmM5sMo/VCjTGQ_cW_I/AAAAAAAAAYs/v5kRiEU2tc0/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-KitchenSettings.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uiN8rmM5sMo/VCjTGQ_cW_I/AAAAAAAAAYs/v5kRiEU2tc0/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-KitchenSettings.png" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><br />Secondly, we set orders. &nbsp;The first is (o) and (h) so that only farmers with the proper labor do plant harvesting, the second is (o) and (m) to prevent things from being mixed in barrels.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z5EFXRaoZXA/VCjTe_7WjoI/AAAAAAAAAY0/kNp-ICEXzfY/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z5EFXRaoZXA/VCjTe_7WjoI/AAAAAAAAAY0/kNp-ICEXzfY/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders1.png" /></a></div><br />Followed by (o)(F)(i) which forbids items when someone dies (such as their socks) and (o)(F)(o) which prevents dwarves from running out to take dead bodies to the coffins.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nm1LYtRaPF0/VCjUFx79cRI/AAAAAAAAAY8/syEyiBi6WmQ/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders2Forbidden.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nm1LYtRaPF0/VCjUFx79cRI/AAAAAAAAAY8/syEyiBi6WmQ/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders2Forbidden.png" /></a></div><br />Third, setting the refuse options (o)(r)(o) make them gather outside refuse and (v) to also gather vermin remains from inside/outside the fort. &nbsp;This also affects garbage dump zones in DF2014, even the dumping of things which are inside the fort.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DVSDV2Ux5qg/VCjUZZfheoI/AAAAAAAAAZE/qYCcRuftOG8/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders3Refuse.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DVSDV2Ux5qg/VCjUZZfheoI/AAAAAAAAAZE/qYCcRuftOG8/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders3Refuse.png" /></a></div><br />Lastly we only allow fishing (o)(z)(f) at specified zones and drinking is only allowed at the defined zones (o)(z)(d).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xr8eD7afShk/VCjU1TELHaI/AAAAAAAAAZM/LERIoggtrNI/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders4Zones.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xr8eD7afShk/VCjU1TELHaI/AAAAAAAAAZM/LERIoggtrNI/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Orders4Zones.png" /></a></div><br />That should keep the dwarves out of immediate trouble.<br /><br />Looking at the civilization menu, there are actually some people listed in the menu for Ropes of Work (no other civs are listed, because we are isolated on an island).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-90nL0WbXh18/VCjVgvuWHNI/AAAAAAAAAZY/_cmtWtOY9Y4/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Civilizations.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-90nL0WbXh18/VCjVgvuWHNI/AAAAAAAAAZY/_cmtWtOY9Y4/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-Civilizations.png" height="64" width="320" /></a></div><br />Fun fact... most of those names are goblins. &nbsp;There are a few exceptions such as the dwarf Arstruk Prairiemonster, administrator in Bellsscorch.<br /><br />DFHack "prospect all" tells us that we have marble for sure and that there is Iron, Silver and Copper ores on this location.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0uSL9oF4rtg/VCjXsn0sSBI/AAAAAAAAAZk/qSVloORLz1U/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-DFHack-Ores.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0uSL9oF4rtg/VCjXsn0sSBI/AAAAAAAAAZk/qSVloORLz1U/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-DFHack-Ores.png" height="43" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

I should have brought a second battle axe instead of a second pick.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6UCIOpT-J3k/VCjZUqicBKI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/pG_SsqtNUvA/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-CannotSeeDwarvesForTheTrees.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FN_ORaS4JB8/VCjrSnypmRI/AAAAAAAAAaI/zwBGeRRLgj8/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-InitialLaborAssignments.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FN_ORaS4JB8/VCjrSnypmRI/AAAAAAAAAaI/zwBGeRRLgj8/s1600/0400-01-Granite15th-InitialLaborAssignments.png" height="35" width="320" /></a></div><br />Turns out that in this area, the aquifer has three layers of soil above it. &nbsp;Given how DF2014 works with tree roots, that means I can dig out my sub-surface farms and initial rooms on the Z98 layer, with Z99 acting as a buffer. &nbsp;If I put buildings or roads on Z100 above any sub-surface farms, it's possible that those farms would be okay.<br /><br />Trying to keep cave adaption at bay is going to be difficult as well. &nbsp;Normally I would dig a huge hole in the ground, cover it over with constructed floors and then have activity zones in those sunlit areas. &nbsp;But with the aquifer, I will have to rethink that strategy.<br /><br />1st Hematite (start of summer), work on the temporary walls, lodgings, underground farms and such is about 80% done. &nbsp;Plans have been drawn up for three bridges on the east/west/south sides.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OlH19k8YkEY/VCnhUpCiBhI/AAAAAAAAAaY/AZXRcyN-Gmw/s1600/04-Hematite1st-Z100-SurfaceWalls.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OlH19k8YkEY/VCnhUpCiBhI/AAAAAAAAAaY/AZXRcyN-Gmw/s1600/04-Hematite1st-Z100-SurfaceWalls.png" height="320" width="290" /></a></div><br />Z100 is the surface, Z99 is the buffer level, and Z98 is the first layer with buildings. &nbsp;Right now, Z98 is dedicated to the farms on the south end, plus a bunch of temporary rooms for workshops running up the main corridor. &nbsp;Due to uncertain conditions, all workshops are being designed so they can be easily sealed off in the case of failed strange moods.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iZNpwtxcSik/VCniCHO8a1I/AAAAAAAAAag/JXIWESOhE6o/s1600/04-Hematite1st-Z098-UndergroundFarms-WorkshopRooms.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-prSODcV8gjs/VCniZvfpoHI/AAAAAAAAAao/iRTMntfJDQk/s1600/04-Hematite1st-Z097-StockpilesPigsAndPrepAreaForPiercing.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SbeO2eKCQhA/VCnmSeqjdhI/AAAAAAAAAa0/aIiVI63o_4s/s1600/04-Hematite1st-Surface-Stonesense.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SbeO2eKCQhA/VCnmSeqjdhI/AAAAAAAAAa0/aIiVI63o_4s/s1600/04-Hematite1st-Surface-Stonesense.png" height="200" width="320" /></a></div><br />Wildlife ('u' menu, 'others') has been tame so far. &nbsp;We have seen geese, ravens, and a few other benign animals.<br /><br />The tentative goals for summer are:<br /><br /><ul><li>Finish the dry moat, the three bridges and hook them up to the only lever.</li><li>Drain that north pond into the dry moat so that it evaporates.</li><li>Collect all of the logged wood and get it into a stockpile.</li><li>Start producing the half dozen pump parts which will be needed for piercing the aquifer.</li><li>Create prepared meals and booze (need barrels).</li><li>Collect and process surface plants in hopes of starting surface farms.</li><li>Dig a few test staircases to see if the aquifer is everywhere.</li></ul><br />We have no mechanisms to be used in traps, so the only reason that I am making spiked wooden balls at the moment is the off-chance of a dwarven caravan in the Autumn season.<br /><br />Piercing of the aquifer will start in mid-late summer at this rate. &nbsp;Establishment of food and booze sources was more of a priority. &nbsp;Plus it is possible that this is a temperate biome and things will freeze in the winter. &nbsp;That could make it faster to pierce the aquifer. &nbsp;First piercing method will remain the dual-slit method with a single pump (and pumper) per level from within the fort. &nbsp;If I see things freeze come winter, then I will prep for a larger scale piercing project in the second winter (a hole big enough for that 11x11 skylight area).<br /><br />8th Malachite - WE GOT MIGRANTS! &nbsp;Praise Armok!<br /><br />9th Malachite - Oh dear, Armok has sent us 8 migrants, doubling our population overnight. &nbsp;This is going to involve a bit of fun and will strain our stockpiles. &nbsp;Especially since we have not yet dug down into the rock layers.<br /><br />22nd Galena - Due to the influx of migrants, we have butchered the draft animals and produced many biscuits. &nbsp;The cook, however, decided to also raid the eggs in the nest boxes which were waiting to hatch. &nbsp;I caught it after a few of the nest boxes had been disturbed, but a few of the nest boxes were still okay. &nbsp;So the bird-hatching program has only suffered a minor setback and not a complete disaster.<br /><br />Note to self: Next time, lock the door to the nesting room.<br /><br />Have also started building upwards using all the wooden logs that we have laying around. &nbsp;The dining room is going to be on the second floor of the courtyard area.<br /><br />I now have a dwarf working in the Farmer's Workshop, threshing any possible plants, as well as "process root", "process plants" and "process fruiting plant" all on repeat until they run out of work. &nbsp;That gave me strawberry seeds, blueberry seeds, raspberry seeds, and soybeans to be planted in the surface crops. &nbsp;Looking at the list, I also now have garlic plants listed as something I can plant.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
