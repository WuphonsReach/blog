Start of year 403. &nbsp;Our civilization has a king, that exists in limbo somewhere (see <a href="http://blog.wuphonsreach.org/2014/10/df2014-gusilsazir-copperbridge-year-402.html" target="_blank">year 402</a>).<br /><br />The expedition leader, Atisadas has a lover now, the doctor Geshudbetan. &nbsp;Then there's Meng Thocitadil who has three cats as pets, well on the way to being the resident cat dwarf. &nbsp;Tosid Vucartastrod and Tun Ngalakkonos are married. &nbsp;No other relations yet, no mothers/fathers outside the fort, no sisters/brothers, or other relations. &nbsp;Some friendships.<br /><br />Fortress wealth is 681k dwarfbucks.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpTdqAI3v3U/VC9kUPncCbI/AAAAAAAAAfY/xHn4E5N-N9o/s1600/01-Stocks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BpTdqAI3v3U/VC9kUPncCbI/AAAAAAAAAfY/xHn4E5N-N9o/s1600/01-Stocks.png" height="119" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />27th Slate - Another werebeast has arrived, this time, a camel.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yjqzHq9Hf8I/VC90sM0NheI/AAAAAAAAAfo/eEGJxstDAoM/s1600/01-Werecamel-Caslu-Ronoguki.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yjqzHq9Hf8I/VC90sM0NheI/AAAAAAAAAfo/eEGJxstDAoM/s1600/01-Werecamel-Caslu-Ronoguki.png" height="72" width="320" /></a></div><br />I do at least have some traps setup around the area, so it's possible that dwarves will escape unscathed. &nbsp;But Tosid Uucartastrod and Udib Lisatablel are outside and probably will not make it back inside quick enough.<br /><br />Nope, they didn't make it back inside - and the fight with the werecamel was brief and violent.<br /><br />1st Limestone (start of Autumn) - The trade depot has been moved about 10 levels underground and stockpiles for things that we will trade away are being constructed. &nbsp;The caravan should be here in a week or two.<br /><br />9th Limestone - The forgotten beast Zimesh Rulushallas Ibrukuker has come! &nbsp;A giant blob of salt... fortunately it is down in the cavern layers where it can't get into the fortress.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sWBDFF7A6PI/VDAP8URvtbI/AAAAAAAAAf4/T4uiiOLmzAc/s1600/09-ForgottenBeast-Zimesh.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sWBDFF7A6PI/VDAP8URvtbI/AAAAAAAAAf4/T4uiiOLmzAc/s1600/09-ForgottenBeast-Zimesh.png" height="62" width="320" /></a></div><br />15th Limestone - Arrival of the liaison and caravan.<br /><br />27th Limestone - Our broker, Itdunkogan, is still on break. &nbsp;Apparently he is all exhausted for helping to beat down that capybara that got into the fort back on the 16th.<br /><br />1st Sandstone - The haulers have only brought 6k worth of goods to the trade depot so far, but the broker was ready to trade, so we purchased 3.5k worth of leather in bins.<br /><br />8th Sandstone - Stupid haulers, busy off doing other things instead of bringing things to the trade depot...<br /><br />13th Sandstone - Haulers finished just under the wire and we bought up about 50 bins of leather and 10 bins of cloth. &nbsp;Now we won't have naked dwarves running around with tattered shoes and socks.<br /><br />14th Sandstone - The liaison is going to make us an official land of the realm. &nbsp;We have to choose a baron. &nbsp;(I chose the broker.)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Uw-c22YWVNs/VDAazSyNGVI/AAAAAAAAAgI/QAFvuPhjJg8/s1600/10-OfficialColony.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Uw-c22YWVNs/VDAazSyNGVI/AAAAAAAAAgI/QAFvuPhjJg8/s1600/10-OfficialColony.png" height="69" width="320" /></a></div><br />20th Sandstone - Six new migrants have arrived and been assigned to help haul stone, furniture and trade goods.
