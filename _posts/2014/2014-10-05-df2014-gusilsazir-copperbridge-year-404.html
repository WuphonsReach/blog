18th Granite in the year 404 - The outer walls of the above ground fortifications are mostly complete. &nbsp;Once the haulers finish clearing the junk off the roof, I can seal that up.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPBPV2ac-3c/VDBuU-NGMzI/AAAAAAAAAgY/_HvdmdeGQBM/s1600/01-SurfaceFortifications.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WPBPV2ac-3c/VDBuU-NGMzI/AAAAAAAAAgY/_HvdmdeGQBM/s1600/01-SurfaceFortifications.png" height="200" width="320" /></a></div><br />If it looks like a box, that is because it is a box at this point. &nbsp;Fortifications still need to be carved in the corner towers for the upper three levels. &nbsp;That will give the marksdwarves places to shoot out from at anything which is close to the walls or the surroundings.<br /><br />1st Hematite - Start of summer. &nbsp;The residential rooms are finally starting to take shape now that glass window production has ramped up. &nbsp;The engravers have been smoothing stone for two-plus years now, so the west side rooms are all mostly ready for beds, cabinets and windows to be installed. &nbsp;Some rooms have already been assigned, which makes for very happy dwarves due to their pretty bedrooms.<br /><br />Population is at 40 dwarves (raised the pop-cap limit to 60 recently). &nbsp;I need more haulers, especially for stone, items and furniture.<br /><br />The baron, 'Broker' Itdunkogan (Charmboat), has issued minor mandates recently. &nbsp;So far, only the export of crossbows and rings have been mandated. &nbsp;Since he likes turkeys, a male has been caged in his bedroom to please him with the gobbling.<br /><br />Nothing much notable happened this year. &nbsp;The caravan came and went and we purchased large quantities of leather, meats, cloth and other sundry items. &nbsp;Buzzards seem to be the predominant form of life that gets caught in the cage traps guarding the entrances. &nbsp;Migration waves have brought the fort up to 57 dwarves.<br /><br />Current stocks of note:<br /><br /><ul><li>4568 prepared meals</li><li>2648 drink</li><li>4508 tanned hides (leather)</li><li>1768 thread</li><li>332 cloth</li><li>480 spare barrels</li><li>940 bins</li><li>323 bags and coffers</li><li>1383 stone blocks available, 2580 placed</li></ul><div>One note on the thread is that apparently I need more then a single spinner to keep up with current farming and processing of pig tails. &nbsp;Or maybe my spinner will get to legendary and work faster.</div>
