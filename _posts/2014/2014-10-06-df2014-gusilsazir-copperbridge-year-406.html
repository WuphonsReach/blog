Tail end of winter 405, a minotaur arrives and attacks the fortress. &nbsp;Two of the dwarves did not make it inside and were killed (one by the raising drawbridge, the other by the beast).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V-HDS-OZ0FI/VDIaVy_eccI/AAAAAAAAAhY/cgtf8bo_FWk/s1600/00-ForgottenBeast-Minotaur.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V-HDS-OZ0FI/VDIaVy_eccI/AAAAAAAAAhY/cgtf8bo_FWk/s1600/00-ForgottenBeast-Minotaur.png" height="56" width="320" /></a></div><br />There was a third dwarf outside. &nbsp;'Hunter' Onuzolak, armed with not much more then a wooden crossbow and wooden bolts. &nbsp;The minotaur was passed out due to over-exertion after fighting with the yak for a few days.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oWhN7bv0v3Q/VDIaqB4-fVI/AAAAAAAAAhg/stDbU1EiN3I/s1600/00-HunterOnuzolak-InitialAttack.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oWhN7bv0v3Q/VDIaqB4-fVI/AAAAAAAAAhg/stDbU1EiN3I/s1600/00-HunterOnuzolak-InitialAttack.png" height="313" width="320" /></a></div><br />The minotaur is not doing well at this point.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZTHwu7DnXvc/VDIbHgJvfjI/AAAAAAAAAho/7VizZETDMio/s1600/00-15th-Status.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZTHwu7DnXvc/VDIbHgJvfjI/AAAAAAAAAho/7VizZETDMio/s1600/00-15th-Status.png" /></a></div><br />Due to the weapon of choice being a wooden crossbow, this is going to be a long battle. &nbsp;And if the minotaur wakes up, it may be a short battle for the hunter. &nbsp;And, no such luck. &nbsp;Perhaps with a metal crossbow things might have turned out differently once he ran out of ammo.<br /><br />23rd Felsite - Eral Lelumnish gives birth to a baby boy. &nbsp;And the minotaur is still wandering around outside. &nbsp;I have engraved slabs for the three dwarves who were killed outside. &nbsp;One of them was a father (Stakud) married to Eral. &nbsp;So she must have been pregnant when Stakud was killed outside.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
