<h3 class="post-title entry-title" itemprop="name"></h3><div class="post-header"></div>Orders Menu (o)<br /><br />(m) Change to "No Mix".&nbsp; Ensures that food is not mixed inside of  barrels, which makes it easier to stockpile the right thing in the right  place.<br /><br />(h) Change to "Only Farmers Harvest".&nbsp; Only farmers will harvest plants  from the farm plots.&nbsp; Has no effect on yield as that is determined at  the point when the seeds are planted.<br /><br />(F)-(i) Change to "Forbid death items".&nbsp; Keeps your dwarves from running out and claiming socks off of the fallen.<br /><br />(F)-(o) Change to "Forbid other dead".&nbsp; Keeps your dwarves from running  out in the middle of a siege to drag corpses to the refuse pile.<br /><br /><br />(r)-(o) Gather refuse from outside.&nbsp; If you keep your refuse piles on the surface, near the butcher shop, you'll want this on.&nbsp; Note that DF2014 (40.13 or earlier) has a bug with regards to inside/outside and garbage dumps.&nbsp; So you will need to turn on (r)-(o) and (r)-(o)-(v) to make sure things get hauled to the refuse pile.<br /><br />(r)-(o)-(v) Gather vermin too.<br /><br />(Quantum stockpiles using minecarts work very well for keeping your refuse pile from having a huge footprint.) <br /><br />(z)-(d) Only zone drinking.<br /><br />(z)-(f) Only zone fishing.<br /><br />(W)-(w) No auto-collection of webs.
