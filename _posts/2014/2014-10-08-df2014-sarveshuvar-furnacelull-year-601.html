1st Granite, Spring 601 - The year started peacefully and new dwarves found their way to our fort. &nbsp;The outer walls and bridges are nearing completion.<br /><br />23rd Felsite - The werepanda Snodub Mugubdang attacks the fort. The raised drawbridges were in place, but not yet hooked up to levers for retraction. &nbsp;So begins the horrors of Felsite, Hematite and Malachite of 601 and the loss of many dwarves. &nbsp;At the start of the attack, there were 21-25 dwarves in the fort.<br /><br />The initial fighting actually went pretty well as the dwarves and dogs swarmed the werepanda and beat it down. &nbsp;Many were injured so I rushed to build a hospital zone, place beds and tables in it, and make buckets, splints and crutches and soap. &nbsp;It looked like the worst was over.<br /><br />19th Hematite - All hell breaks loose for three days as two or three dwarves transform into werepandas and attack other people in the fortress. &nbsp;Population drops quickly to just 12-15 dwarves as the recovering wounded are slaughtered in the hospital.<br /><br />23rd Hematite - Werebeasts transform back to dwarves. &nbsp;Tantrums are thrown. &nbsp;More wounded are brought to the hospital, a new chief medical dwarf is named. &nbsp;More coffins are built and more dead are buried.<br /><br />17th Malachite - Fighting starts up again. &nbsp;More deaths. &nbsp;Werepanda Woodcutter Degel Eggutatir Stigil Odur fights and kills numerous dwarves before bleeding to death.<br /><br />20th Malachite - Fighting ends. &nbsp;The remaining six dwarves start burying the dead.<br /><br />2nd Galena (late-summer) - Clean-up after the disaster of the last three months. &nbsp;Here is the event log from 14th Malachite to 2nd Galena.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uQMZ9eItTF8/VDV3fj_UukI/AAAAAAAAAmU/5Dy_D_ibsvY/s1600/07-News.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uQMZ9eItTF8/VDV3fj_UukI/AAAAAAAAAmU/5Dy_D_ibsvY/s1600/07-News.png" height="26" width="320" /></a></div><br />With 21 deaths in the fortress over the last few months, I would guess that we will not see any migrants.<br /><br />8th Sandstone - Lokum throws a tantrum in his 1x1 cell.<br /><br />16th Sandstone - Migrants surprise! &nbsp;Unfortunately, two of the arrivals are just children, so the working population only went up to 12 dwarves.<br /><br />3rd Opal - Casualty #22 as Eshtan Cattenastel succumbs to melancholy and dies of dehydration. Meanwhile, Lokum in his cell is ecstatic because he threw something.<br /><br />4th Obsidian - It is starting to look like Lokum will never starve/dehydrate in his cell. &nbsp;He may, however, go mad at some point.
