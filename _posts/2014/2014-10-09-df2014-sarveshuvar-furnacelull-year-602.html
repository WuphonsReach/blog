20th Granite -&nbsp;'Crafter Nish' Erushdakon is now haunting the fort. &nbsp;Some part of his mangled body must have ended up in a refuse pile instead of a coffin. &nbsp;He seems to like pestering our walled in werepanda,&nbsp;Lokum Kalankol. &nbsp;Hopefully that keeps him busy while I engrave and place a slab.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o39FtmbvXo4/VDXSlb0245I/AAAAAAAAAmk/sL8u4yZQ-0M/s1600/01-CrafterNishGhost.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o39FtmbvXo4/VDXSlb0245I/AAAAAAAAAmk/sL8u4yZQ-0M/s1600/01-CrafterNishGhost.png" height="35" width="320" /></a></div><br />Well this is a bit strange, one of the dwarves is robbing the grave of 'Crafter Nish', taking his parts (teeth) out of the casket and taking them to the surface refuse pile. &nbsp;Another dwarf is carrying the bits back to the tomb. &nbsp;Then immediately turns around and carries it back to the refuse pile. &nbsp;The only way to seemingly stop it is to catch them in the act of carrying it and then forbid it when they are in the tombs area.<br /><br />I threw down (3) slabs because when I scrolled through the entire list, I found not only 'Crafter Nish' but also the original werepanda and another dwarf that possibly never got buried (or not completely).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
