9th Slate, 604 - 18 Dwarves alive (plus 4 werepanda/dwarves). &nbsp;'Were" Alath Tusestushat is still babbling away in her cell, apparently the transformation into a werewolf every moon cycle keeps her from starving / dehydrating.<br /><br />The hospital is fully stocked again. &nbsp;Armok forbid that we need it again, but it's likely.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gbZX84YRa5U/VDk0bUEOTyI/AAAAAAAAAqs/r1LI0fypUm4/s1600/02-HospitalStocks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gbZX84YRa5U/VDk0bUEOTyI/AAAAAAAAAqs/r1LI0fypUm4/s1600/02-HospitalStocks.png" /></a></div><br />War dogs have been trained. &nbsp;Two are chained in the entrance. &nbsp;Chained, so that they cannot give chase of anything coming across the bridge (which is currently closed).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UdB8KZ9iO8E/VDk0r_XJN4I/AAAAAAAAAq0/DWxRkzIetNk/s1600/02-WarDogsInEntranceOnChains.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UdB8KZ9iO8E/VDk0r_XJN4I/AAAAAAAAAq0/DWxRkzIetNk/s1600/02-WarDogsInEntranceOnChains.png" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br />The rest of the trained war dogs (eight to ten) are in a pasture around the bend.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j9HV6GMeTic/VDk1K2TtLmI/AAAAAAAAAq8/297A-zWVGq8/s1600/02-PastureOfWarDogs.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j9HV6GMeTic/VDk1K2TtLmI/AAAAAAAAAq8/297A-zWVGq8/s1600/02-PastureOfWarDogs.png" height="262" width="320" /></a></div><br />Hopefully 10-12 trained wardogs, near the entrance, will give us a fighting chance against more werepanda attacks.<br /><br />27th Slate - Two migrants arrived.<br /><br />11th Sandstone - The werelizard Ago Ongasaslot has come! &nbsp;Of course it shows up right during trading season while the gate is open. &nbsp;On the other hand, the caravan is here with all of their guards.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WeOWWDdZBqE/VDl9HJIgIOI/AAAAAAAAArM/iE4-ZGjoFKU/s1600/10-WereLizard-AgoOngasaslot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WeOWWDdZBqE/VDl9HJIgIOI/AAAAAAAAArM/iE4-ZGjoFKU/s1600/10-WereLizard-AgoOngasaslot.png" height="78" width="320" /></a></div><br />'Hunter' Domas Ingizletmos dies first, then Urvad Duthnurartir and Avuz Kutambomrek. &nbsp;Adil Enshaliden dies next on the bridge. &nbsp;At this point the werelizard is barely wounded and engages the two war dogs chained in the entrance. &nbsp;One dies, the other is stunned. &nbsp;Atir Rigothducim jumps in and gets thrown from the bridge and into the dry moat. &nbsp;Cog Veshtulon is nearby and rushes to help. Cog falls quickly, but Atir gets a reprieve as the werelizard transforms back into a goblin and runs away.<br /><br />Atir is chasing to goblin now! &nbsp;Not well, given how wounded he is.<br /><br />7th Timber - This is like watching a ticking time bomb. &nbsp;I couldn't manage to get Atir isolated in the hospital, and now instead of being an obedient lever puller (so I could wall him in somewhere), he is wandering around the fortress "on break". &nbsp;The chance of him having the were-curse is near 100% based on past experience. &nbsp;If he transforms while in the dining room, there's a chance - because that is where all the war dogs currently are located.<br /><br />Yeah, no such luck, he transformed in the middle of the main stairwell and infected even more dwarves before being put down.<br /><br />24th Timber - Have managed to wall away the newly infected, except for one who is too injured to take a job, but refuses to stay in the hospital. &nbsp;Nor will she stay in any one place long enough to get walled in.<br /><br />4th Moonstone - Fikod is still running free in the meeting hall, infected and soon to transform. &nbsp;She is surrounded by war dogs, however, so it should be a short rampage. &nbsp;Only luck protects us from a further spread of the plague.<br /><br />6th Moonstone - Fikod goes on a rampage as a werelizard, far away from the meeting hall where all the war dogs are stationed... she kills 'Woodsy' Zulban Dmuatbasen in a bedroom, but since there are doors everywhere, is content to just sit around because she can't see any new victims.<br /><br />Deaths this year - five? &nbsp;That would mean about thirty-three deaths so far in the fortress, with just ten surviving dwarves (and seven were-dwarves).<br /><br />Late-winter, things are slowly getting back to normal. &nbsp;I'm doing a crash wall-building spree because the trees are growing up in the dry moat and that could provide a way for things to enter the fort.<br /><br />Eight of the survivors have been drafted into a militia squad (leather armor, iron crossbow) called 'The Silvery Boots'.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NK5Fn76qrFg/VDmiJdY8JoI/AAAAAAAAArc/ZO2yO-agt58/s1600/12-MilitiaSilveryBoots.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NK5Fn76qrFg/VDmiJdY8JoI/AAAAAAAAArc/ZO2yO-agt58/s1600/12-MilitiaSilveryBoots.png" height="84" width="320" /></a></div><br />They are set to train one month out of the year.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fRNwGXz7pQg/VDmiTJN1v0I/AAAAAAAAArk/2iapdmSB_AA/s1600/12-SilveryBoots-Schedule.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fRNwGXz7pQg/VDmiTJN1v0I/AAAAAAAAArk/2iapdmSB_AA/s1600/12-SilveryBoots-Schedule.png" height="79" width="320" /></a></div><br />Very basic leather uniform.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--uoFK5PLmOA/VDmiglPii1I/AAAAAAAAArs/CeU7Q_VWRw4/s1600/12-SilveryBoots-Uniform1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--uoFK5PLmOA/VDmiglPii1I/AAAAAAAAArs/CeU7Q_VWRw4/s1600/12-SilveryBoots-Uniform1.png" height="117" width="320" /></a></div><br />A quick check reveals that I need a few more wooden shields.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WW4NFABIweQ/VDmi53pYXXI/AAAAAAAAAr8/YR-5W_hN1B8/s1600/12-SilverBoots-NotEnoughWoodShields.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WW4NFABIweQ/VDmi53pYXXI/AAAAAAAAAr8/YR-5W_hN1B8/s1600/12-SilverBoots-NotEnoughWoodShields.png" height="95" width="320" /></a></div><br />Private Rovod Mosusmedtob has a quiver and iron crossbow, plus lots of leather.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HpROvY032c4/VDmjR-8LaKI/AAAAAAAAAsE/YYEgmufS5zs/s1600/12-PvtRovod.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HpROvY032c4/VDmjR-8LaKI/AAAAAAAAAsE/YYEgmufS5zs/s1600/12-PvtRovod.png" height="250" width="320" /></a></div><br />Six deaths this year.<br /><br /><br /><br />
