1st Granite - 9 adult dwarves, 1 child, 7 were-cursed dwarves (locked away) and thirty-three dead dwarves since year 600. &nbsp;And I'm just now getting around to forming a militia using eight of the 9 adult dwarves (the miner is excluded from duty).<br /><br />I have around 1000 drinks and 2000 prepared meals. &nbsp;We will not die of thirst or starvation in the near future.<br /><br />Most of the survivors are content / happy / ecstatic - but the imprisoned were-cursed dwarves are naturally unhappy.<br /><br />17th Slate - Five migrants have arrived. &nbsp;Three adults and two children. &nbsp;Four of them are part of a family:<br /><br />Vabok Rithalak - Father, no strong skills<br />Mafol Tiristesmul - Mother, High Master Blacksmith<br />Avuz Lorfikuk - Child<br />Asen Ferezum - Child<br /><br />The fifth is a carpenter named Dodok Fokeronul. &nbsp;Both Dodok and the mother, Mafol, will be drafted into the militia, while the father gets drafted as a miner.<br /><br />The bridge went back up as soon as they made it inside.<br /><br />17th Felsite - 'Pvt' Rovod Mosusmedtob is a cat hoarder...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xrTCwhM3dMk/VDnZmFBmtwI/AAAAAAAAAsU/QPPH_t27vFw/s1600/03-RovodMosusmedtob-CatHoarder.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xrTCwhM3dMk/VDnZmFBmtwI/AAAAAAAAAsU/QPPH_t27vFw/s1600/03-RovodMosusmedtob-CatHoarder.png" height="99" width="320" /></a></div><br />I'm going to pasture all eleven of the foul little beasties into his bedroom. &nbsp;And decrease the number of jobs assigned to the fort's butcher so that they get butchered prior to adopting dwarves.<br /><br />1st Limestone - Time to open the gates while we wait for the dwarven caravan, and hope that they make it inside.<br /><br />21st Sandstone - Eight migrants show up.<br /><br />15th Timber - Fortress sealed up again.<br /><br />Late winter... no deaths. &nbsp;Now have 26 dwarves (3 are children) plus the 7 were-dwarves.<br /><br /><br />
