1st Granite - Flooding is under control. &nbsp;Population is 47 dwarves (7 were-dwarves, 3 children, 2 babies). &nbsp;Starting to setup the deep underground depot at Z+60, will deconstruct the surface level (Z+103) depot soon.<br /><br />Plans proceed for flooding and killing the were-dwarves. &nbsp;The aquifer is being dug into and a lever-controlled door has been setup in the corridor which will drill into the aquifer. &nbsp;This opens into an area below which can be flooded through a floor grate. &nbsp;The were-dwarves will then be instructed to deconstruct the walls separating them from the water.<br /><br />12th Slate - Five of the seven were-dwarves have been drowned in their cells. &nbsp;One of them was the old expedition leader, and even though I replaced them in the nobles menu, the dwarven liaison has refused to meet with me for a few years now. &nbsp;That meant we could not request specific items from the caravan or form trade agreements.<br /><br />Also, while letting the were-dwarves mingle, it was discovered that they do not all change form at exactly the same instant. &nbsp;As a result, two of them fought. &nbsp;Both were werepandas when changed.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
