1st Granite - Start of a new year. &nbsp;Forty-nine deaths so far in the fort since the founding in year 600 (I drowned five of the seven were-dwarves last year). &nbsp;There are sixty-eight citizens (four children, two babies) plus the two were-dwarves alive.<br /><br />The slaughterhouse (butcher's workshop) is going non-stop to keep up with births of cats, dogs and the six varieties of egg-laying fowl. &nbsp;Plus the migrants who bring along livestock.<br /><br />The leatherworkers and clothiers are working to create enough leather/cloth items for all of the new migrants and military uniforms. <br /><br />15th Slate - Led Astisuzol gives birth to a boy.<br /><br />28th Slate - Migrants arrived, a monster of a migration wave with 22 dwarves showing up. &nbsp;Ninety-two total dwarves now including the two were-dwarves, and there are now four children and three babies included in that count.<br /><br />7th Felsite - The forgotten beast in the first cavern layer has been observed to breathe fire.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AWF4HX2nIVw/VDwXEqrSKpI/AAAAAAAAAuo/aEmM8BoZyzo/s1600/11-ForgottenBeast-OzobSodorstuzang.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AWF4HX2nIVw/VDwXEqrSKpI/AAAAAAAAAuo/aEmM8BoZyzo/s1600/11-ForgottenBeast-OzobSodorstuzang.png" height="64" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cRXfJF9XD-E/VDwXCGSe-qI/AAAAAAAAAug/oR5-i1cTHoA/s1600/05-ForgottenBeastBreathesFire.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cRXfJF9XD-E/VDwXCGSe-qI/AAAAAAAAAug/oR5-i1cTHoA/s1600/05-ForgottenBeastBreathesFire.png" height="131" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />20th Felsite - I have spotted a ghost wandering around outside. &nbsp;I'll need to go make sure a slab gets engraved for Kogsak Egulsibrek and others.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YfxlAWxK76U/VDwVPr6dQSI/AAAAAAAAAuU/6s01UN3EL7Y/s1600/05-GhostSpotted.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YfxlAWxK76U/VDwVPr6dQSI/AAAAAAAAAuU/6s01UN3EL7Y/s1600/05-GhostSpotted.png" /></a></div><br />Looks like a few slabs were engraved, but never placed for the merchants of the autumn caravan.<br /><br />20th Malachite - Migrants have arrived, it should be a modest sized wave since I am close to my population cap of 100. &nbsp;Six arrivals, no real interesting in the lot.<br /><br />Two magma smelters are up and running, but waiting on the haulers to haul the metallic ores and economic stone down to the basement. &nbsp;It's around 140-steps from the forges to the surface (ugh). &nbsp;Ran out of wheelbarrows for the additional QSP (quantum stockpiles) needed to feed the smelters.<br /><br />My current plan is two smelters and two forges, with room for two more of each. &nbsp;Because I'm using QSPs, the layout is very compact. &nbsp;One of the QSPs is for low-quality metal items which are worth melting down (returning at least 90%).<br /><br />3rd Galena - Rovod Uzoltad gives birth to a baby girl. <br /><br />Gates have been thrown open in order to cut down all the trees in the north/northwest and haul the wood inside before winter. &nbsp;I'm sure that it will end in tears, but I need charcoal for steel production at the magma smelters.<br /><br />12th Galena - Muthkat Ekirsazir gives birth to a boy.<br /><br />1st Timber - Raised to a duchy.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zEhxEbkrhkI/VDyHFS0quYI/AAAAAAAAAu4/jMb4r0FvBVI/s1600/08-RaisedToDuchy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zEhxEbkrhkI/VDyHFS0quYI/AAAAAAAAAu4/jMb4r0FvBVI/s1600/08-RaisedToDuchy.png" height="39" width="320" /></a></div><br />2nd Opal - The Giantess Mela Eti Itheyi (the Torch of Prestige) has come! &nbsp;Fortunately, the bridge is up, so I believe the worst she can do is mill around outside.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-THP7sbPgqyE/VDyjDJiO9UI/AAAAAAAAAvI/XrZEQhx2kKE/s1600/11-GiantessMelaEtiItheyi.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-THP7sbPgqyE/VDyjDJiO9UI/AAAAAAAAAvI/XrZEQhx2kKE/s1600/11-GiantessMelaEtiItheyi.png" height="56" width="320" /></a></div><br />14th Opal - 'Smith' Mafol Tiristesmul gives birth to a baby girl.<br /><br />2nd Obsidian - Led Astisuzol gives birth to a baby boy.<br /><br />11th Obsidian - Somehow, Olon Udarlitast ended up outside the walls of the fort. &nbsp;As a result, the giantess killed her. &nbsp;I have no idea how she got outside, she must have fallen off the ramparts. <br /><br />The giantess is dead, she wandered across our weapon traps one too many times and passed out on top of a trap.<br /><br />
