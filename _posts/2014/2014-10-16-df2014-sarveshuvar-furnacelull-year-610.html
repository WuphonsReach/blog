16th Slate - Migrants arrive. &nbsp;Just ten dwarves. &nbsp;They can go on hauling duty.<br /><br />(My plan for 610 is fort clean-up... all the socks scattered everywhere, getting all the stone hauled. &nbsp;This should be an uneventful year - unless Armok has other plans for us.)<br /><br />19th Hematite - 'Doc' Muthkat Ekirsazir has given birth to a girl.<br /><br />23rd Hematite - Migrants arrive. &nbsp;Six of them. &nbsp;More haulers.<br /><br />21st Galena - The cooks have been busy, the egg stockpile has shrunk from 13k down to 8k. &nbsp;Naturally, this means that the prepared foods count is now over 14k. &nbsp;Hopefully we can sell off about 3/4 of that to the autumn caravan along with all the worn-out socks.<br /><br />1st Limestone - Autumn has come, the caravan will arrive soon. &nbsp;The gate is lowered in preparation (if the depot is inaccessible, the caravan immediately turns around and leaves the map).<br /><br />10th Limestone - Caravan and liaison have arrived.<br /><br />13th Limestone - Trade agreement.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RgWsxBKVmqM/VD_8EmnqC8I/AAAAAAAAA10/eemN2QVSieA/s1600/07-TradeAgreement.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RgWsxBKVmqM/VD_8EmnqC8I/AAAAAAAAA10/eemN2QVSieA/s1600/07-TradeAgreement.png" height="76" width="320" /></a></div><br />2nd Sandstone - Started the trade. &nbsp;The dwarves have hauled 506k worth of goods to the depot. &nbsp;The trader is going to be very pleased. &nbsp;The trader only brought 212k of goods that were worthwhile to purchase, leaving the trader with a 295k profit.<br /><br />9th Sandstone - 'Smith' Mafol Tiristesmul gives birth to a baby boy. &nbsp;I'm still waiting for the caravan to leave the gates so that I can seal things back up for the winter.<br /><br />15th Sandstone - Gate sealed for winter. &nbsp;Workshops are back to normal production levels.<br /><br />7th Timber - Rovod Uzoltad gives birth to a girl. &nbsp;This is her 5th surviving child. &nbsp;And I finally figured out that she was given a crutch back on 25th Moonstone 609.<br /><br />I actually have six dwarves who have some training in crutch-walker now.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vCYHJeGWZaY/VEAhtadF_vI/AAAAAAAAA2E/paM2xHYnyA4/s1600/10-CrutchWalkers.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vCYHJeGWZaY/VEAhtadF_vI/AAAAAAAAA2E/paM2xHYnyA4/s1600/10-CrutchWalkers.png" height="61" width="320" /></a></div><br />But I'm 90% sure that only Rovod is using a crutch at the moment.<br /><br />14th Opal - Throwing the gates open because Tobul Atoravuz decided to jump down and land outside the walls. &nbsp;As did Iton Gimastesh.<br /><br />Ended the year with not much happening. &nbsp;That's okay. &nbsp;Steel weaponry was produced for the three "pillars" squads and they now train on a 2 months training / 2 months off-duty schedule. &nbsp;I'm going to start looking for much stronger dwarves soon.
