1st Granite - Spring has arrived. &nbsp;A quick look at the happiness meter reveals mostly content/happy/ecstatic dwarves. &nbsp;The two were-dwarves are never happy, but I don't care about them.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MVhs3DzmK2w/VEBQRWtL4PI/AAAAAAAAA2U/gqhfI0B7ZRk/s1600/00-DFMonitor.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MVhs3DzmK2w/VEBQRWtL4PI/AAAAAAAAA2U/gqhfI0B7ZRk/s1600/00-DFMonitor.png" /></a></div><br />I now have about 150 bedrooms for the dwarves, each is 2x2, engraved, with a bed and cabinet along with doors in the corners. &nbsp;They are all set for first-come first-serve. &nbsp;I plan on finishing out the fourth layer this year, bringing us to 196 total bedrooms.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g7ZEE627PtU/VEBQq3yPs3I/AAAAAAAAA2c/C1yOSFPNOmU/s1600/00-Bedrooms.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g7ZEE627PtU/VEBQq3yPs3I/AAAAAAAAA2c/C1yOSFPNOmU/s1600/00-Bedrooms.png" height="320" width="177" /></a></div><br />Furnacelull is now a city and created wealth is about 6.5 million. &nbsp;The drink stocks are at 1200, which is roughly 10 drinks per dwarf.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZEuInQFHQ1s/VEBRFgdF2oI/AAAAAAAAA2k/wScAe4giH5Q/s1600/00-City-Status.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZEuInQFHQ1s/VEBRFgdF2oI/AAAAAAAAA2k/wScAe4giH5Q/s1600/00-City-Status.png" height="121" width="320" /></a></div><br />The cooks have fallen behind on turning eggs into fancy lavish meals, so we have 2500 meat, 285 fish, 9300 eggs and 15 cheese. &nbsp;The number of prepared meals is up to 12,800. &nbsp;Hopefully I can drop that number to about 6000 after the caravan arrives in the fall.<br /><br />Ammo stocks are so-so. &nbsp;Ideally I want about 100 metal bolts per marksdwarf. &nbsp;So with five squads of ten dwarves, I'd want about 5000 metal bolts. &nbsp;I only have about 1500 metal bolts. &nbsp;Before I bulk up the marksdwarf militia squads, I need to bulk up my metal ammo supplies. &nbsp;I have 165 iron, 127 copper, 147 steel, and about 75 bronze bars. &nbsp;If I convert the 127 copper and 75 bronze into bolts that gives me about 5000.<br /><br />I'll produce those using a novice weaponsmith. &nbsp;Turning off my two near-legendary weaponsmiths from producing any weapons for the duration.<br /><br />The (3) "pillars" squads now all have masterwork steel battle axes. &nbsp;Future recruits will probably ask for other things. &nbsp;I'll start production of iron armor and they'll be assigned "metal" armor in a few months. &nbsp;Since I want high-quality armor right off the bat, I'll let my near-legendary armorer make those pieces.<br /><br />The Archery range only has room for (4) targets. &nbsp;I will be constructing a second one in the SE corner.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Uo9g07QTFdg/VEBY9bXGaAI/AAAAAAAAA20/7gTR8dmMXC4/s1600/00-ArcheryLevel.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Uo9g07QTFdg/VEBY9bXGaAI/AAAAAAAAA20/7gTR8dmMXC4/s1600/00-ArcheryLevel.png" /></a></div><br />Note the open spaces between the firing lanes. &nbsp;The misses are collected on the floor below.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gkVDCpt-edc/VEBZD08MG_I/AAAAAAAAA28/K_RaIEsgOkk/s1600/00-ArcheryBoltCollectionLevel.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gkVDCpt-edc/VEBZD08MG_I/AAAAAAAAA28/K_RaIEsgOkk/s1600/00-ArcheryBoltCollectionLevel.png" /></a></div><br /><br />18th Granite - 'Doc' Muthkat Ekirsazir has given birth to a boy. &nbsp;Discovered that the resident scaredy-cat dwarf, Ber Kivishashmon, is outside the fortress walls. &nbsp;Lowering the gate to let him back in.<br /><br />28th Slate - Drafted some more female dwarves into the marksdwarf militia squads that train twice per year for a month. &nbsp;So I have 59 dwarves drafted into militia/military squads.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PjcR7MPTzlc/VEB3FYho8GI/AAAAAAAAA3M/ghIN5Oc9H0I/s1600/03-SquadMemberCounts.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PjcR7MPTzlc/VEB3FYho8GI/AAAAAAAAA3M/ghIN5Oc9H0I/s1600/03-SquadMemberCounts.png" /></a></div><br /><br />9th Hematite - Gave all the squads a "move here" order a week ago, let them mill around for a few days, then cancelled the station order. &nbsp;That should get them all to go grab equipment, especially the new recruits. &nbsp;Throwing open the gates and going to harvest trees and collect wood for the next 6 months.<br /><br />8th Malachite - 'Smith' Mafol Tiristesmul gives birth to a baby boy.<br /><br />18th Malachite - The werepanda Bosa Axtutsong has come!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RSErmDNTce4/VECVMMFMaoI/AAAAAAAAA3c/qspcjkA4loU/s1600/05-Werepanda-BosaAxtutsong.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RSErmDNTce4/VECVMMFMaoI/AAAAAAAAA3c/qspcjkA4loU/s1600/05-Werepanda-BosaAxtutsong.png" height="73" width="320" /></a></div><br />Urvad Roderiton is first up. &nbsp;A member of the Silvery Boots, but poorly equipped. &nbsp;Inod Kelrithlut is second to join in on the fight and Risen Sarveshkidet is third. &nbsp;None are good fighters or have armor. &nbsp;Urvad is strangled to death, Inod gets thrown into the moat and Risen is keeping distance.<br /><br />(Somehow Lolor Thunenlikot manages to fall off the wall to death.)<br /><br />Note: Inod has been bitten during the fight.<br /><br />Etur Gusiliden, a member of Silvery Boots is next to start fighting. &nbsp;She at least has leather armor on and a wooden shield, but no crossbow yet. &nbsp;However, bolts are starting to fly from the tower where the rest of the Silvery squads are stationed. &nbsp;She has been bitten, so will need to be isolated.<br /><br />Inod and Etur take the fight down into the dry moat. &nbsp;Both are pretty banged up, but are putting the hurt on the werepanda. &nbsp;Bembul Oslanlorbam jumps down in the moat and joins in followed by 'Woodsy' Kogan Solonetost.<br /><br />19th Malachite - The werepanda, Bosa, has transformed back into a goblin. &nbsp;Dwarves are still giving it the beatdown in the dry moat.<br /><br />27th Malachite - Dwarves are in the hospital and are being tended to, all squad members are stationed in the hospital, waiting the next full moon.<br /><br />5th Galena - Rovod Uzoltad gives birth to a boy. &nbsp;Her and 'Teacher' Minkot Kelziril now have six children.<br /><br />6th Galena - Inod has been released from the hospital and given the order to pull a lever repeatedly while a squad of marksdwarves watches from a safe distance. &nbsp;The other injured and possibly infected were worse off and are still in the hospital under guard.<br /><br />Three other squads are shadowing Kogan, who we suspect is infected.<br /><br />15th Galena - Inod is struck down.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5aHT81rE8SA/VECjxOFTXnI/AAAAAAAAA3s/pRSQ3Z2W5CI/s1600/06-Inod1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5aHT81rE8SA/VECjxOFTXnI/AAAAAAAAA3s/pRSQ3Z2W5CI/s1600/06-Inod1.png" height="102" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Dq45qUuKzqA/VEEoMaZO21I/AAAAAAAAA4E/QtBNAeYdvu4/s1600/10-ExportAgreement.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Dq45qUuKzqA/VEEoMaZO21I/AAAAAAAAA4E/QtBNAeYdvu4/s1600/10-ExportAgreement.png" height="77" width="320" /></a></div><br />23rd Moonstone - Etur Gusiliden has gone berserk in the hospital.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EjSXPrJAFMg/VEErGZrHYCI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/_TeS4IqrJ9Q/s1600/10-EturGoesBerserk.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EjSXPrJAFMg/VEErGZrHYCI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/_TeS4IqrJ9Q/s1600/10-EturGoesBerserk.png" height="47" width="320" /></a></div><br />Etur is quickly struck down by Stinthad Lularineth and Sodel Ushrirstigaz.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wwkXT3Mw5Xc/VEErvvpfjDI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/pPwEsueX070/s1600/10-EturStrukDown.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wwkXT3Mw5Xc/VEErvvpfjDI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/pPwEsueX070/s1600/10-EturStrukDown.png" height="270" width="320" /></a></div><br />16th Obsidian - Things are quiet in the fort. &nbsp;The dwarves are still hauling wood from the forest that was cleared. &nbsp;Military skills are coming along well. &nbsp;Steel armor was produced for most of the melee squad.<br /><br />Production of gold furniture has started. &nbsp;There are about 600 bars of gold and 600 raw ore in the stock listing.
