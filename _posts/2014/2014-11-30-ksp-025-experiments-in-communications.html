I'm using a mod (RemoteTech-v1.5.1) that requires communication link networks to be established. &nbsp;The easiest way to do that is to orbit 3-4 satellites in equatorial orbit around Kerbin at approximately the same orbit period and spaced apart.<br /><br />Current testing of the Valkyrie III line of communication satellites reveals a problem with battery reserve power. &nbsp;Reserve battery is 610 units large and it runs out of electrical power while passing behind Kerbin (first estimate is approximately 2/3 through the transit). &nbsp;That means periodic blackouts during at least part of their orbit and they will not be able to link to the other units in the solar system.<br /><br />Valkyrie satellite is at around 506-510k meters altitude (Ap/Pe). &nbsp;Orbit velocity is approximately 1785 m/s. &nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin" target="_blank">Kerbin's diameter</a> is 1.2 Mm. &nbsp;To cross 1.2 Mm at 1785 m/s takes 673s. &nbsp;Approximate orbit time is 64.5 minutes.<br /><br />Planned power usage is (2) Comms DTS-M1 running (0.82/s each), (1) Communotron 16 (0.13/s each), and (1) Reflectron DP-10 (0.01/s). &nbsp;That gives a total of about 1.78/s - so the 610 units in the battery lasts for only 343s (of the ~673s transit, oops!).<br /><br />So in order for things to work correctly, I need around 1400 battery power, plus enough solar cells to recharge the batteries before each dark side pass. &nbsp;A stack of seven&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Z-200_Rechargeable_Battery_Bank" target="_blank">Z-200 Rechargeable Battery Bank</a> would do the job. &nbsp;Definitely not the most cost efficient, but they are available early on in the tech-tree.<br /><br />Planned payload (est. cost of 7810):<br /><br />(1@60) DP-10 - 500km range (used for launch)<br />(1@300) C16 - 2.5 Mm range (activated at 80km altitude)<br />(2@600) DTS-M1 - 50 Mm range (one pointed to KSC, one to "Active Ship")<br /><div><br /></div><div><div>(18@100) OX-STAT PV Panel</div><div>(7@360) Z-200 Battery Packs</div></div><div>(1@600) Small Inline Reaction Wheel</div><div><br /></div><div>(2@425) FL-T200 Fuel Tank</div><div>(1@750) LV-909 LFE</div><div><br /></div><div>Lower stages (est. 9750 recoverable, 1950 non-recoverable):</div><div><br /></div><div>(1@400) TR-18A Stack Decoupler</div><div>(2@700) Mk2-R parachute</div><div>(4@850) FL-T400 Fuel Tank</div><div>(1@950) LV-T45 LFE</div><div>(6@600) TT-38K Radial Decoupler</div><div><br /></div><div>(6@325) RT-10 SRBs (disposable)</div><div><br /></div><div>That puts the total lift costs at around 20280 including fuel (19510 dry). &nbsp;This is a successful design that seems to work well for the purpose, but I will need to test it out with the (7) battery packs instead of just (3) packs. &nbsp;Still, that's only 40kg on top of 5705kg launch weight, so it won't affect things.</div><div><br /></div><div>Naturally, I'm low on funds at the moment in career mode after launching (5) of the Valkyrie III series. &nbsp;So I will need to go complete a few contracts, then launch a few of the Valkyrie IV line of communications relays.<br /><br />Additional lessons learned:<br /><br />The number of OX-STAT PV panels that you will need is an art and not a science. &nbsp;You need to assume that your satellite will be in the worst possible configuration to get power (engine towards the star). &nbsp;My designs with 18 or 24 panels and a 1.8/s drain often resulted in an orbiting brick. &nbsp;No power to do anything with it at all, even if it had a line of sight to the ground station.<br /><br />For the Hermes line of 1.5Mm relay stations, I'm going with (36) PV panels. &nbsp;Twelve are on the sphere of the Stayputnik Mk I, the other (24) are at the bottom of the T400 fuel tank that is used for maneuvering fuel. &nbsp;These also have about 2200 units of battery capacity.<br /><br />After putting a satellite into orbit and before leaving it alone for a while, I reorient it to be side-on and "vertical" to the star. &nbsp;Then I leave the SAS running in hopes that it will stay mostly oriented properly to the star.<br /><br />If your satellite does run out of power you either have to wait for it to (eventually) turn around as it orbits, or send out a Kerbal on a EVA to push it around. &nbsp;A satellite that has its engines pointed at the star should slowly get back into a side-on position as it makes its way around the orbit.<br /><br />Advanced Comm Satellite Theory:<br /><br />#1 - You always need a Reflectron DP-10 to get off the launchpad and downrange into space. &nbsp;It only has a 500km range, so you will want to deploy other antennas as soon as possible once you hit 75km altitude (out of the atmosphere). &nbsp;It only pulls 0.01 EC/s, which is very minor.<br /><br />#2 - You always need a Communotron 16 running. &nbsp;This is a 2.5Mm (25km) range that draws 0.13 EC/s.<br /><br />#3 - Ideally, you should have (3) Comms DTS-M1. &nbsp;One to link to KSC when it is in view, two to link to the other two equatorial orbit satellites. &nbsp;These are directional and have a range of 50 Mm (50000 km).<br /><br />#4 - You should have one Reflectron KR-7. &nbsp;This should link to the actively piloted vessel. &nbsp;KR-7 is directional with a range almost twice that of the DTS-M1 (90 Mm or 90000 km).<br /><br />That's (4) running at 0.82 EC/s, plus the Comm 16 running at 0.13 EC/s plus the DP-10 at 0.01 EC/s. For a total draw of 3.42 EC/s. &nbsp;Assuming 3.5 EC/s, a 1000km altitude orbit will require 2900 EC of reserve battery power. &nbsp;A synchronous orbit at&nbsp;2868.75 km requires 4200 EC of reserve battery power.<br /><br /><br /></div>
