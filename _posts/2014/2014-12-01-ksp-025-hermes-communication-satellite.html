(This is from Kerbal Space Program 0.25 with the&nbsp;RemoteTech-v1.5.1 mod. &nbsp;One of the requirements of Remote Tech is that unmanned probes have a two-way communication link back to the mission control at Kerbin Space Center.)<br /><br />Currently, I have (5) satellites in stable orbits around Kerbin. &nbsp;The range on the "Communotron 16" is 2500km and Kerbin has a radius of 600km. &nbsp;In order for satellite A to talk to satellite B, the orbital diameter needs to be under 2500km (worst-case). &nbsp;2500km / 2 = 1250km radius, minus the 600km radius of Kerbin puts orbital altitude at 650km.<br /><br />Note: Since Kerbin blocks line of sight (LoS), the orbits can be slightly larger then 650km.<br /><br />The other way to estimate the correct orbital distance is to find the orbit whose&nbsp;circumference is around (N x 2500km). &nbsp;Assuming three satellites and a circumference of (2500 x 3), this gives a radius of 1190km, or an altitude of 590km above the surface of Kerbin. &nbsp;This is a very naive calculation and the orbit can actually be larger<br /><br />In the case of an equilateral triangle where all three satellites are evenly placed around Kerbin, you can calculate the radius as (N / sqrt(3)) where N is 2500km. &nbsp;That gives an orbital radius of 1443km (843km altitude).<br /><br />So the best range for (3) equatorial satellites is 590-843km above the surface. &nbsp;It is probably best to shoot for 750-800km orbit altitude which gives you a margin of error. &nbsp;The assumption here is that we use the 2500km omnidirectional antenna to talk to KSC and the DTS-M1 directional links to talk to the (2) sister satellites with the 3rd link being used to talk to the "active" ship.<br /><br />Update: I am going to go with 700km altitude orbit and (4) satellites on the equator. &nbsp;They can be setup roughly equidistant from each other and can all communicate using the 2.5Mm omnidirectional Comm-16 antenna.<br /><br /><b>Hermes I</b> - &nbsp;In 700km altitude orbit.<br /><br />2210 EC 1.78 EC/s (36) OX-STAT PV Panels<br /><br />DTS-M1 #1 Active Vessel<br />DTS-M1 #2 (OFF)<br />DTS-M1 #3 Hermes III-B<br /><div><br /></div>For running all (3) Comms DTS-M1 antennas, power drain is 2.6 EC/s which requires 1999 EC reserve power for the 769s orbit dark period at 750km. &nbsp;By tightening up the orbit to only be 700km, we only need 1968 EC reserve power for the transit.<br /><br /><b>Hermes II-A</b> - Nearly perfect 700km orbit.<br /><br />2210 EC 1.78 EC/s (36) OX-STAT PV Panels<br /><br />DTS-M1 #1 Active Vessel<br />DTS-M1 #2 (OFF)<br />DTS-M1 #3 Hermes III-B<br /><br /><b>Hermes II-B</b> - Orbit is approximately 700km altitude.<br /><br />2210 EC 1.78 EC/s (36) OX-STAT PV Panels<br /><br />DTS-M1 #1 Active Vessel<br />DTS-M1 #2 (OFF)<br />DTS-M1 #3 Hermes III-B<br /><div><br /></div><b>Hermes III-A</b> - Target 12.676Mm orbit (just past Mun)<br /><br />2210 EC 1.78 EC/s (36) OX-STAT PV Panels<br /><br />DTS-M1 #1<br />DTS-M1 #2<br />DTS-M1 #3<br /><div><br /></div>DV Fuel: 3644 m/s (~55% full), Mass (current): 2848kg<br /><br />Highly elliptical orbit (10188 km Ap 303km Pe). &nbsp;Currently having communication difficulties back to KSP which prevents the Ap burn to circularize the orbit and raise the Ap to 12.7Mm.<br /><br /><b>Hermes III-B</b> - Needs minor orbit tuning<br /><br />2210 EC 1.78 EC/s (36) OX-STAT PV Panels<br /><br />DTS-M1 #1 Active Vessel<br />DTS-M1 #2 Mission Control<br />DTS-M1 #3 (DO NOT USE)<br /><br />DV Fuel: 3354 m/s (~50% full), Mass (current): 2641kg<br /><br />Synchronous orbit approximately above KSC. &nbsp;Current orbit is 2846km Pe / 2886km Ap. &nbsp;A perfect synchronous orbit is&nbsp;2868.75 km. &nbsp;Minimum required battery for orbital dark period (1195s) is 2128 EC. &nbsp;There is not enough power to run a 3rd DTS-M1 link during the dark period.<br /><br /><br />
