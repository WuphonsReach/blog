Now that I have the basics of Kerbal Space Program mostly mastered (I can get to orbit easily), it's time to push the difficulty up a notch by installing DRE (Deadly Reentry), FAR (Ferram Aerospace Research) and&nbsp;TAC Life Support mods. <br /><br />DRE requires that your reentry craft have heat shields, parachutes can't be deployed until below 350 m/s. &nbsp;That will result in lots of toasty kerbals if you are not careful.<br /><br />FAR boosts the difficulty of getting out of orbit because it introduces a better aerodynamic model over the simplistic KSP model. &nbsp;That means your rockets can be torn asunder during lift by air forces flowing over their surfaces unless you use fairings and other aerodynamic covers.<br /><br />TAC boosts the difficulty of keeping your Kerbals alive for that "one more orbit" that is needed to get them back on the ground. &nbsp;You can no longer leave Jebadiah in orbit for months and years at a time without food and water.<br /><br />
