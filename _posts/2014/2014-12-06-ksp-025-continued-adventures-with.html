Now that I have my KEO (geo-sync) relay satellites up. I can start picking up contracts for satellite orbits.&nbsp; Here is the overhead view of Kerbin with the Remote Tech mod installed:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mpmmoFRHS0I/VIM3ZtrDvII/AAAAAAAAA-0/sz2QdzLGw-M/s1600/KSP%2B2014-12-06%2B11-52-40-60.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mpmmoFRHS0I/VIM3ZtrDvII/AAAAAAAAA-0/sz2QdzLGw-M/s1600/KSP%2B2014-12-06%2B11-52-40-60.png" height="180" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />There are (3) sats in 700km altitude orbits around Kerbin (the innermost ring of three) that have 2.5Mm range omni-directional antennas installed.<br /><br />I need to put up a 4th to fill in that hole in the coverage.&nbsp; Right now, depending on view angles, a newly launched probe will be out of communications for about 60 degrees of LKO (low Kerbin orbit).&nbsp; This is not a real big deal as long as the Ap/Pe values are above 70km for the new launch.&nbsp; If the Ap (Apoapsis) node comes around at an awkward time when both KSC and all of the LKO mesh network stats are not visible, I can just wait for the next orbit.<br /><br />On the right side of the image is a pair of orange lines indicating directional links to my two KEO relay sats.&nbsp; These have 50Mm directional antennas installed.&nbsp; One antenna always points at KSC (the orange line) and the other antenna will automatically target the "active vessel" which is whatever ship that I am flying at the time.<br /><br />For example, in this image I have selected the Callisto III satellite that is taking care of those orbital contracts out by the Mun.&nbsp; The green line is the currently active communication path, grey lines are omni-directional antenna links, and the orange lines are directional antenna links.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aypnsy4rc5A/VIM2ZjcaIOI/AAAAAAAAA-s/XP6hPooeB_g/s1600/KSP%2B2014-12-06%2B12-01-08-85.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aypnsy4rc5A/VIM2ZjcaIOI/AAAAAAAAA-s/XP6hPooeB_g/s1600/KSP%2B2014-12-06%2B12-01-08-85.png" height="180" width="320" /></a></div><br />The trick with directional antennas is that *both* sats have to dedicate a directional antenna to maintaining the link.<br /><br />Assuming that none of the sats drift out of position, communications are pretty good all the way out to Minimus (the outer moon of Kerbin).&nbsp; Future improvements to the network will be to put even longer range directional antenna units into KEO, but those are further down the tech tree.<br /><br />New contract details:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TtPG5nONMhQ/VIM0MW3s6hI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/DmeFQX26SfA/s1600/KSP%2Bnew%2Bmission%2Bcontract%2Bfor%2Bequatorial%2Borbit%2Bout%2Bpast%2BKEO.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TtPG5nONMhQ/VIM0MW3s6hI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/DmeFQX26SfA/s1600/KSP%2Bnew%2Bmission%2Bcontract%2Bfor%2Bequatorial%2Borbit%2Bout%2Bpast%2BKEO.png" height="320" width="268" /></a></div><br />This is a pretty easy contract to fulfill as the orbit is outside of KEO but inside of the Mun's orbit.&nbsp; I will still use one of my over-designed Callisto III vehicles to handle it, because after fulfilling the contract I can move the Callisto III out to orbit around the Mun to handle comms within that SoI (sphere of influence).<br /><br />The Callisto III rockets current cost&nbsp; 23,160 to launch and I'm recovering about 8500 with the Stage Recovery mod for a net cost to orbit one of these 50Mm range comm-sats of about 14.7k.&nbsp; Orbital contracts pay out about 50k (+/- 5k), so I'm making a very nice profit on the launches.&nbsp; Especially if I can manage to service 2-3 contracts with a single launch.
