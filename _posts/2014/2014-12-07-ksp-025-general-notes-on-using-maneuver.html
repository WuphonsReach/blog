Notes for <a href="http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Maneuver_node" target="_blank">orbit changes using Maneuver Nodes</a>:<br /><ul><li>Prograde burns are the most fuel efficient at Pe.</li><li>Retrograde burns are the most fuel efficient at Ap.</li><li>Circle-izing burns are best done at Ap (and only enough to fix eccentricity).</li><li>Normal / Anti-Normal (purple markers on Nav-Ball)&nbsp; burns to match a target orbit's inclination are best done at the An/Dn intersection with the current orbit.</li><li>Radial burns (cyan markers) are never very efficient.</li></ul>Basically, if you want to speed up (make the orbit larger), you want to time your burn for when your absolute (or orbit) velocity is highest due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect" target="_blank">Oberth effect</a>.&nbsp; If you want to change direction, time your burns for Ap (when you are moving the slowest).<br /><br />Other tricks that are not immediately obvious:<br /><ul><li>Left-click once on a maneuver node to select it and display the (6) buttons for adjusting the burn.</li><li>Right-click once on a currently selected node to switch between the (6) buttons for adjustment and the (3) buttons that allow you to either delete the node or postpone it until a later orbit.</li><li>When the (6) burn adjustment buttons are displaying, you can use the scroll wheel on the mouse to adjust the individual vector amounts (hover the mouse over the vector).&nbsp; This is sometimes easier then grabbing the vector button and pulling it in/out using the mouse.</li><li>When the (6) vector/burn adjustment buttons are displayed, you can use the center circle to move the time of the maneuver forward/backward along the currently projected orbit path.</li></ul>Example of using the maneuver node to perform an adjustment:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EY71Cv4Ox2c" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Notes for video:<br /><ul><li>Align your nav-ball on the blue target and leave it there through the burn.</li><li>When the blue target runs away, it is time to stop the burn.</li><li>Using the "m" key to switch to map mode and opening up the nav-ball at the bottom of the screen can give more accurate burns.</li><li>Start your burn as close to the maneuver node as possible (usually 30s before is good).</li></ul>
