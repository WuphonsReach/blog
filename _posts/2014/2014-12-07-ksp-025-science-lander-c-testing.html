Trying to create an early payload that carries (4) Science Jr's, a pair of Mystery Goo pods and other assorted elements along with a Kerbal.<br /><br />The early tests worked so-so...<br /><br />Test #1 was just to verify that the payload could land soft enough on Kerbin to protect the Science Jr's from landing shock. <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2L1ixjtmnTs" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Test #2 was an attempt to get up into the upper atmosphere.&nbsp; It failed, but the emergency abort system worked well enough for a soft touchdown.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QdoPNZ9pD9M" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Test #3 was another attempt to get higher into the atmosphere, and it failed even more spectacularly.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RBbGQ-8Az5o" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Back to the drawing board...<br /><br />Third iteration of the Science Lander.&nbsp; The science payload consists of:<br /><ul><li>(2) Mystery Goo experiments</li><li>(3) 2HOT Thermometers</li><li>(4) SC-9001 Science Jr</li></ul>Other elements in the payload stage are:<br /><ul><li>Command Pod Mk1</li><li>Seperatron I rockets used for abort system</li><li>LT-1 Landing Struts</li><li>Five 1.25m Heatshields to protect Science Jr and landing legs</li><li>(2) HexCan Life Support Waste-Small and (2) small life support supplies (44 days)</li><li>(2) Comm-16 antenna</li><li>(2) KE-S210 Kethane scanner (250km range)</li><li>RCS jets and FL-R25 fuel tank (inline, 1.25m) </li><li>T400 fuel tank + LV-T45 LFE</li></ul>Payload stage TWR is 1.88, DV is 742 m/s, cost is 11083 and mass is 5036kg.&nbsp; It's a moderately heavy payload (5 tons).&nbsp; The Callisto III satellites are only 2970kg.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AKEgjX8uGeM" width="640"></iframe><br /><br /><br />Parts count for the launch is ~175.&nbsp; Launch cost is 71.4k (a sizable fraction of my current funds).&nbsp; Hopefully with Stage Recovery I can get about 1/2 of the booster / second stage costs back (about 21k estimated).&nbsp; Which would bring the cost per launch down to about 50k.<br /><br />Launch mass is 164 tons and the payload stage is only 5 tons (plus about 6 tons for the support module with the orbital engine / equipment).<br /><br />Control is via (3) Advanced Inline Stabilizer reaction wheels plus a small inline reaction wheel at the top of the capsule (plus what is integrated into the Mk1 command pod).&nbsp; Bottom of the booster stage has the (4) AV-T1 winglets.<br /><br />Expectation is that during the boost phase, only SAS will be running and no attempts to correct rocket trajectory will be made.&nbsp; Hopefully with the reaction wheels and tail fins, the SAS can keep the rocket vertical.&nbsp; With 1541 m/s of DV in the booster stage (using twelve BACC SRBs), I'm hoping for a separation altitude of 10-15km.<br /><br />Gravity turn will start around 30-40km of altitude.<br /><br />Final check of the strutting, staging, position of equipment.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zHb_X5VEAAw" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Ouch, expensive failure.&nbsp; Not only was the craft mostly destroyed, but the launch pad was damaged for 128k repair costs.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/u_DQwQ_hjjM" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />Looks like I need struts between the stages rather then depending on that little connector.&nbsp; Since I am going from a tri-symetry to quad-symetry stage, the struts are rather willy-nilly and probably not the best.&nbsp; The important thing when doing struts along the vertical axis is that you have lots of V's and X's.<br /><br />Since I can't afford to test launch again, I will need to go back to completing orbital contracts for funds.
