One of the mods that I have installed is called "Kethane".&nbsp; It adds a resource called "Kethane" to the surfaces of the various worlds and moons in the solar system.&nbsp; This resource can be refined and turned into rocket fuel, but first you have to find the pockets.<br /><br />The easiest way to start scanning for Kethane (with the Remote Tech mod) is a simple Stayputnik Mk1 satellite with the KE-S210 radial scanner mounted.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7HAt9tUvLQM/VIXXAdxV7KI/AAAAAAAABBc/K9t08xg0ja8/s1600/KSP%2B2014-12-08%2B11-50-15-68.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7HAt9tUvLQM/VIXXAdxV7KI/AAAAAAAABBc/K9t08xg0ja8/s1600/KSP%2B2014-12-08%2B11-50-15-68.png" height="180" width="320" /></a></div><br />Note that you only need one radial scanner active, but I have installed two in order to keep the satellite balanced along the axis.<br /><br />Payload cost is only 6850 with a mass of 922kg.&nbsp; At the time I did not have the better types of solar panels or smaller fuel tanks or advanced batteries.&nbsp; With a few minor changes I could probably get the cost below 6000 and drop the mass slightly.&nbsp; It does need a bit more battery power then shown here and 800-1000 EC would be better if you absolutely need to map the dark side of the planet/moon.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this only has a Comm-16 with a 2.5Mm range for  communications, so you will need longer-range relay satellites around  Mun/Minimus to relay commands from KSC.&nbsp; By doing it that way, this satellite does not need mass-heavy batteries in order to power the DTS-M1 or KR-7 directional antennas.<br /><br />(The 2HOT temperature probe on the side of the craft is useless and can be removed.)<br /><br />The best way to scan for surface deposits is with polar orbits.&nbsp; So your first launch should be either due North or due South from KSC.&nbsp; A little bit of tilt is fine and you just need a roughly circular orbit below 200km above the surface (a 100km orbit is just about perfect).<br /><br />Once you have your scanning satellite in orbit, sit back and watch it run:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6k2tkYe64w0" width="640"></iframe><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-uqk_n8OyRI" width="640"></iframe><br /><br />As you can see, the higher inclination of the probe at the Mun gives better coverage to the top/bottom of the Mun.
