I've progressed enough through the tech tree in Kerbal Space Program 0.25 to unlock the 60Gm communications antenna (KR-14) and the 5Mm Comm-32 antenna.<br /><br />From left to right, here are the directional antennas that I have unlocked:<br /><ul><li>KR-7 (90Mm range)</li><li>DTS-M1 (50Mm range)</li><li>KR-14 (60Gm range)</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0eTsTIBDJeU/VInybHeZZXI/AAAAAAAABBs/Nk881_LjrLs/s1600/KSP%2BComms-DTS-1%2BKR-7%2BKR-14.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0eTsTIBDJeU/VInybHeZZXI/AAAAAAAABBs/Nk881_LjrLs/s1600/KSP%2BComms-DTS-1%2BKR-7%2BKR-14.png" height="274" width="320" /></a></div><br />As can be seen, the KR-14 is huge compared to the KR-7.&nbsp; I can barely get (3) of them inside the ZeroPoint payload fairing on the 1.25m sized parts.&nbsp; It works as long as you use the extended width fairing and mount them on Z-200 battery packs in the middle.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k11UikvmK6I/VInzLylucCI/AAAAAAAABB0/W0hei14d_O8/s1600/KSP%2BComms%2BKR-14%2BTriple.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k11UikvmK6I/VInzLylucCI/AAAAAAAABB0/W0hei14d_O8/s1600/KSP%2BComms%2BKR-14%2BTriple.png" height="320" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ktl_gkpNprM/VInzhY1hcBI/AAAAAAAABB8/7w7AVQ54CRA/s1600/KSP%2BComms%2BKR-14%2BTriple%2BB.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ktl_gkpNprM/VInzhY1hcBI/AAAAAAAABB8/7w7AVQ54CRA/s1600/KSP%2BComms%2BKR-14%2BTriple%2BB.png" height="284" width="320" /></a></div><br />This particular satellite is very over-engineered with 4600 battery capacity, six of the 1x6 solar panels (4 at top, 2 down by engines), an RCS system, three of the KR-14 antenna, and two DTS-M1, and one Comm-32.&nbsp; Payload weight is 7.2t with a cost of 28.5k funds.<br /><br />Total launch cost is 68360, 100.2t of mass, and a booster DV of 4769 m/s.&nbsp; The lifter stage is all a single stage that burns only SRBs for the first 2 minutes, then lets three LV-T45s take over.&nbsp; It is not the most cost effective, but it is reliable for 6-8t payload weights.<br /><br />This monster is designed to be parked in keosynchronous orbit (KEO) in a 2869km altitude orbit.&nbsp; There will be two of them parked in KEO as far ahead/behind of KSC as possible.&nbsp; It can then maintain the following links:<br /><ul><li>Comm-32 links to Mission Control at KSC (and other LKO/KEO sats)</li><li>DTS-M1 points at Mun's SoI</li><li>DTS-M1 pointing at Minimus</li><li>KR-14 pointing at Moho</li><li>KR-14 pointing at Duna</li><li>KR-14 pointing at Eve</li></ul>With the Remote Tech mod, pointing a satellite in one SoI (sphere of influence) at a planet/moon in another SoI means that any vehicles within the target's SoI will be able to automatically form a network between the two SoI's.<br /><br />For example, satellite #1 is orbiting in KEO with an antenna link back to Mission Control (usually a DTS-M1 or Comm-32) and a directional antenna is pointed at Minimus.&nbsp; A satellite at Minimus has a directional antenna pointed at Kerbin.&nbsp; The two satellites will form a two-way link, without having to specifically point #1 at #2 and vice versa.<br /><br />The caveats of just pointing the antenna at another SoI are:<br /><ul><li>The two satellites must be in different SoI's.&nbsp; So this works best for satellites that orbit one planet/moon to create a network with satellites orbiting a different plant/moon.</li><li>Line of sight rules still apply (on both satellites).</li><li>The longer range antennas have very restrictive cone widths, so use the right one for the expected distance.&nbsp; The DTS-M1 and KR-7 are the right ones to use for links between Mun/Minimus/Kerbin.</li></ul>Because of the LoS (line of sight) issues, my plan is to setup two more of these monsters, one at the Mun and one at Minimus.<br /><br />The Mun/Minimus versions will need to swap out the DTS-M1s for KR-7s.&nbsp; The planned links will then be:<br /><ul><li>Comm-32 linking to other sats around Mun/Minimus</li><li>KR-7 pointing at either Mun or Minimus</li><li>KR-7 pointing at Kerbin's SoI</li><li>KR-14s point at Moho, Eve and Duna</li></ul>Note - what I really need in order to handle all tasking inside of Duna's orbit is about (6) of these KR-14 antennas setup at Kerbin's SoI.&nbsp; The targets would be:<br /><ul><li>Sun</li><li>Moho</li><li>Eve</li><li>Duna</li><li>Active Vessel</li><li>Dres (sometimes out of 60Gm range)</li></ul><br />Missions inside of Kerbin's orbit could get away with using a Comm 88-88 (40 Gm range) to link back to Kerbin.&nbsp; Missions to Dres would need a KR-14.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
