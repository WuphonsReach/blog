Keeping track of contracts (Fine Print mod) in Kerbal Space Program tends to get complicated. &nbsp;For some of the orbital contracts, you have to bring along specialized equipment in addition to matching the specified orbit. &nbsp;I forget to do this about half the time. &nbsp;I need to make up a spreadsheet to track outstanding contracts and what launches are dedicated to fulfilling those contracts.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />Minimus:<br />- Science from high orbit (Mystery Goo)<br />- Science from low orbit (Temperature, Magnetometer, Orbital Telescope)<br />- Orbital contract at 180 degrees of inclination and 290-300km<br /><br />Mun:<br />- Orbital contract at 153 inclination and 980-1431km<br />- Orbital station housing at least 7 kerbals<br />- Surface base housing at least 5 kerbals.<br /><br />Kerbin:<br />- Orbital contract, 0 degrees inclination, 9060-11219 km, w/ Double-C Seismic Accelerometer<br />- Orbital contract, 10 degrees inclination, 13337-14397 km, no special equipment<br /><br /><br />
