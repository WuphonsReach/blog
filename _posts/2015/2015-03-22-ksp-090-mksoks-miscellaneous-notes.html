I've been trying to wrap my head around the MKS/OKS mod which allows you to build surface bases / orbital stations which have closed or nearly closed recycling systems.&nbsp; It also provides for resource extraction from the surface and <a href="http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545" target="_blank">construction of vessels</a> outside of Kerbin's Space Center complex.&nbsp; Some information is available on the <a href="https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki" target="_blank">MKS wiki</a>, while other information is buried in the <a href="http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-0-90-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-22-8%29-2015-02-27" target="_blank">KSP forum thread</a>.<br /><br />The bare minimum for a colony is:<br /><ul><li>C3 (produces punch cards)</li><li>Kerbitat (maximum of one per base)</li><li>Aeroponic (maximum of one per base)</li><li>Inflated living space (required by Kerbitat, may need multiple)</li><li>Inflated greenhouse (required by Aeroponic module, may need multiple)</li><li>Storage space&nbsp;</li><li>Power </li></ul>For a surface colony, that is enough to support 2 kerbals.&nbsp; For an orbital colony, it will support up to 10 kerbals if you use 2x inflated greenhouses per inflated habitation ring.&nbsp; You also need storage space for food/water/oxygen, waste / waste water / carbon dioxide, biomass / compost, excess machinery, and spare parts.<br /><br />Note: Spare parts cannot be transferred from point A to point B without EVA'ing kerbals.&nbsp; All other resources can be moved around using the stock method for moving LF/Ox fuel or monoprop fuel.&nbsp; Or with mods like Ship Manifest. Spare Parts (and Machinery) get consumed over (a long) time of facilities operations.<br /><br />Design Note: You <i>never need more then one Aeroponic module and  one Kerbitat module per base/station</i>. If your food/water/oxygen  production is falling behind, then you need more storage for inputs/outputs and/or more  inflatables to boost production.<br /><br />EPL Note: When using EPL (Extraplanetary Launchpads), you must have kerbals with a medium to low stupidity rating and at least two stars of experience along with an adequate supply of Rocket Parts.&nbsp; MKS/OKS also hides a lot of the stock EPL parts and substitutes its own versions as well as changes the manufacturing chain for production of Rocket Parts.<br /><br />One possible flow chart for MKS/OKS manufacturing:<br /><a href="http://s177.photobucket.com/user/Sir_Snoopy/media/MKSResourceFlow.png.html">http://s177.photobucket.com/user/Sir_Snoopy/media/MKSResourceFlow.png.html</a> <br /><br />One way to make 3-star kerbals is to (plan on 60-80 mission days):<br /><ol><li>Orbit the Mun</li><li>Land on Minmus</li><li>Leave Kerbin's SoI and orbit Kerbol</li><li>Land back on Kerbin and recover the kerbals</li></ol>RareMetals and ExoticMinerals come from the refining module and are good sources of funds if sent back to Kerbin for recovery (~700 funds/unit?).&nbsp; Chemicals and Polymers may also be suitable for returning to Kerbin for funds.<br /><br />Design note: The minimum MKS/OKS base crew is enough engineers to get the Kerbitat/Aeroponics lab to 50% efficiency.&nbsp; They do not have to be located specifically in a particular module, but you may wish to do so because <i>putting the right kerbal into the module has an impact on efficiency</i>.&nbsp; Engineers are preferred over Pilots/Scientists for most modules (Engineers are best, Scientists are second-best and Pilots are worst).&nbsp; Experience stars matter a lot <i>for efficiency</i> (2-stars is probably the minimum viable, but 1-star kerbals can work in a pinch).<br /><br />Design note: Biolabs require Substrate as a working material.&nbsp; So you will need to harvest or ship in Substrate in order to get useful outputs from the Biolab.<br /><br />Note: The Orbital Shipyard part requires that EPL be installed - otherwise it does nothing.&nbsp; This also applies to the other ship construction part, the Mobile Launchpad.<br /><br />Operation note: If you are going to turn on Dampeners, only turn it on for <b>one</b> of your modules.&nbsp; This feature can help you reduce the bouncing, but turning on multiple dampeners tends to cause bad things to happen.&nbsp; The Dampener is designed to clamp the craft to the surface and disable physics for the rest of the base.&nbsp; Anchors, OTOH, increase the mass of the module by 2-3 tons and help with CoM (center of mass) issues.<br /><br />Design note: The heaviest modules should be at the center of the base.
