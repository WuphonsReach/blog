With the MKS/OKS and EPL mods (or just EPL alone), it's possible to build rockets in orbit instead of launching them from KSC on Kerbin.&nbsp; Or you can build on the surface of a different world.<br /><br />Approximate cost to LKO (90km orbit above Kerbin's surface) for 9600 RocketParts is about 105k funds or about 10.9 funds/part.&nbsp; I'm using the StageRecovery mod to recover the boosters, otherwise you'd have to use a spaceplane to get costs that low.&nbsp; It's possible that I could drive costs lower by launching even more RocketParts in a single launch (maybe 10/part).<br /><br /><br />You also have to ship up any consumable supplies, like rocket fuel, RCS fuel, life support as they are not included in the EPL construction process.<br /><br />Another requirement is that you need engineer kerbals with at least 2 stars of experience.&nbsp; Preferably with only low-medium stupidity levels.&nbsp; Plus life support if you use TAC-LS.<br /><br />A single RocketPart weighs 2.5kg and costs 5 funds.<br /><br />Update #1: Tested out a 495k gross funds launch vehicle, capable of putting 28.8k of RocketParts into LKO (17.2 funds/part).&nbsp; That should be about 144k cost for the raw RocketParts with the rest of the cost for the booster and infrastructure.&nbsp; StageRecovery results in about a 225k refund for a net launch cost of 270k or about 9.375 funds/RocketPart.<br /><br />
