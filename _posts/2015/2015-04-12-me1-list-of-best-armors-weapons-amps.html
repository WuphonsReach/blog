Playing Mass Effect 1 again this past week.&nbsp; One of the useful things to know is "what should I keep"?<br /><br />Tier 4+ unlocks around level 18, tier 7+ unlocks around level 36.<br /><br />Ammo upgrades: Around level 36 you should start keeping as many of the Tungsten VII and Shredder VII ammo upgrades as you can find.&nbsp; They stop dropping after that point, but are still the best anti-synthetic and anti-organic rounds.<br /><br />Armor: Predator (green camo) 7+, Colossus (red/black) 7+, Phantom (turian only) 7+. Note that there are also the Geth Armory armors in the tier 7-10 range, but I don't care for their look.<br />Biotic amps: Savant is pretty much the only game in town starting at tier 7.&nbsp; Polaris at tier 4+ is okay.<br /><br />Omni-Tools: Savant is best for 7+, Nexus or Logic Arrest Tool for tiers 4+<br /><br />Pistols: HWMP Master VII or X, Karpov, Razer, Brawler, Raikou (tier 4+)<br /><br />Sniper: Punisher 7+, Harpoon 7+, Volkov 7+, HMWSR Master VII or X<br /><br />Assault Rifle: Geth Pulse 7+, HMWA Master VII or X, Raptor 4+, Tsunami 4+<br /><br />Shotgun: Katana 4+, Avalanche 7+, Tornado 1+, Sokolov 7+, HMWSG Master VII or X
