Still playing Planetside 2 at least 2-3 evenings per week for a few hours on one of my numerous ScrapyardXYZ incarnations.&nbsp; Usually on the Emerald server, but sometimes on Connery.&nbsp; Which server and which faction I play depends on my mood, what the fights are like, what corp members are online and whether there is a good outfit platoon running.<br /><br />About 3/4 through Batman: Arkham Asylum on easy mode.&nbsp; It's interesting, wasn't sure I'd like it, but the only bit I don't like are the Scarecrow levels.&nbsp; My primary complaint with the Scarecrow levels is that it's a hard-fail if you get spotted.&nbsp; Other bosses and fights are more forgiving where you can make a few minor mistakes but still come out on top.&nbsp; But then I also hated hard-fail things in WoW raiding as well where you had to be 100% perfect in order to down the boss.<br /><br />Been too busy to pickup EQ2 again or login to Wildstar.&nbsp; Finally changing jobs after 15 years as I got tired of working 60-80 hour weeks and still making what I made 15 years ago.&nbsp; So a bit of topsy-turvy over the next two months as I sort out a new place to live and get settled in.<br /><br />Waiting on KSP 1.0 to stabilize.&nbsp; There are still major outstanding bugs in 1.0.2 that need fixing before it is worth picking up.
