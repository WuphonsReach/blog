I've been getting the Minecraft itch lately, but not sure what server I want to go back to.&nbsp; So for the moment, I'm probably going to just do a bit of touring.<br /><br />The most infamous sever out there is apparently <a href="http://2b2t.org/" target="_blank">2builders2tools</a>, which is a complete free-for-all, ganking and griefing paradise.&nbsp; I'm not quite ready for that, mostly because you always spawn at near the 0,0 coordinates.&nbsp; If it would randomize your respawn to a much larger radius it would be more interseting.<br /><br />So I'm looking into poking around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/" target="_blank">Civcraft's 2.0 server</a> instead.&nbsp; The server is semi-vanilla, but has some different rules like "Prison Pearls", randomized spawning anywhere within the 15,000 block radius, and the ability to reinforce placed blocks using iron or diamonds.&nbsp; Last night there were 30-40 people online, but in my two hours of wandering, I never saw a soul.<br /><br />For those looking for human contact, I have the following notes (hopefully current as of Oct 2015).&nbsp; But I make no guarantee of their veracity or whether the situation has changed.<br /><ul><li>Go in expecting to get ganked, pearled, and griefed.</li><li>Thule is an underwater city around -8000,+4000</li><li>Mount Augusta is the current "big" city, which draws both good and bad, down around +2600,+2100</li><li>NOX and Carson (-4400,+1500) seem to be in conflict</li><li>Icenia is up near -6500,-6500</li><li>The supposed <a href="https://puu.sh/jPhO3/efcbaf7fe5.png" target="_blank">map of claimed areas</a> (moderately out of date).</li><li>Libra, Arran, Athens, Yoahtl, Kaiserinreich, SPQR are possibly places to visit</li><li>Avoid Mises and probably Carson and&nbsp; the area Northeast of Kappi (so avoid +1800,-1100)</li></ul>
