Because this is a PvP server, there are a lot of ways to get griefed.&nbsp; One of the latest abuses <a href="https://github.com/Civcraft/NameLayer/wiki" target="_blank">NameLayer</a> and the auto-accept group invites feature.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the command "/nltaai" that turns auto-accept off is a toggle, so you have to be careful in using it.<br /><br />The server is having a bit of a TPS problem (command "tps"), so there's some hand-wringing and witch-hunting and bans for introducing lag.<br /><br />Another <a href="http://www.iontom.com/2014/12/17/neverwhere-geographies-histories-in-civcraft/" target="_blank">observer's report</a> from about 10 months ago.&nbsp; A <a href="http://imgur.com/rlJR82p" target="_blank">political map</a> from about 9 months ago.&nbsp; A <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XN8lcJq.png" target="_blank">map of SQPR territory</a> linked from their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CivcraftRoma/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.<br /><br />Botting is huge on CivCraft; it seems to be a frequent topic of hate in the CivCraft Reddit and makes the server very hostile to new players.&nbsp; Seems like most of the economy has collapsed at this point due to the over-supply from botted accounts.
