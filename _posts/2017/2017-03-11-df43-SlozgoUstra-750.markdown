Slozgo Ustra (The Universes of Forever) is a medium world created by a custom configuration in Dwarf Fortress 0.43.05 in Linux 64bit.  
I've been waiting for v0.43 to stabilize for quite a while, and DFHack for 0.43 has finally entered beta testing.

# Population

The world is fairly diverse, with lots of civilizations still in existence at year 750.  
Only 12 of the 40 civilizations have fallen, with a small handful hanging by a thread.

    3744 Dwarves
    2468 Humans
    1299 Elves
    63409 Goblins
    1644 Kobolds

    Total: 72564

Unfortunately, the Legends Viewer application is a bit unstable, so it's hard to drill down into the history of the world.

# World Generation

```
Created in DF v0.43.05.
