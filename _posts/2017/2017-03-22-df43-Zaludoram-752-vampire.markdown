Well, I have a vampire infestation in the fortress.  A mechanic was found drained of blood in the dormitory.

{% include gallery id="gallerym" %}

My immediate suspicion is going to be that it is one of the [most recent migrants]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017/2017-03-21-df43-Zaludoram-751-752.markdown %}).  The other possibility is that it is one of the elf merchants, but that is much harder to deduce.

Looking through the dfHack labor management screen (which looks a bit like Dwarf Therapist's UI), "îton Ustuthekast, Leatherworker" looks suspicious.  Accomplished in the use of armor, shield, dodging, discipline and observer.  Very high social skills in persuasion, judge of intent, intimidator and comedian.  Arrived at the fortress in 751-08 (it's now 752-02).

The description has a possible giveaway, no thoughts of food, drink or sleep since arrival in the fort almost 6 months prior.  There were no witnesses to the crime, but the presense of the body in the dormitory (no individual bedrooms in the fortress yet) means that it was quickly discovered.  Interestingly, even though there are no witnesses in the justice screen, he was horrified after seeing Tulon die.

Since vampires have aliases, finding him or her in the world history would be difficult to impossible.  Engraving some walls or making some statues may provide clues as the engravers are telepathic.

For now, I'm going to start carving out a set of permanent rooms for the vampire, whomever they are.
