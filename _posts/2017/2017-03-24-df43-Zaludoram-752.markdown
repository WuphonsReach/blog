The vampire has been locked away in its quarters for the rest of its unnatural days.  I used a screw pump set on "pump manually" with îton as the only dwarf with that labor enabled, which helped quarantine it.

It did manage to drain one additional dwarf before I finished digging, smoothing, engraving and stocking its lair.  The rooms are hopefully ornate enough to serve any future promotions.

One room doubles as a temple to Sheñe, (deity: festivals, dance, revelry, music), the diety that it worships.  In retrospect, that probably should have been a giveaway as well.  A dwarf that worships one of the human dieties (Neutral Confederation).

îton is now the job manager and bookkeeper.
