753 and 754 were quiet years for the fortress, except for the were-lizard that showed up in early 753.  It was put down somewhat quickly, but three dwarves were infected, isolated and eventually walled away or killed.

The magma forges have been setup under the first cavern layer, and melting and smelting has started.  It will be a year or two before I find enough iron to outfit a squad of axe or mace dwarves.  I have lots and lots of copper, lead, silver, zinc and nickel.
