Welcome to Sil Dakon (The Planes of Omen), year 600.  This is a [medium sized custom generated world](/blog/imgs/df/SilDakon/region1-world_gen_param.txt) for Dwarf Fortress 43.05.  History is hidden by default, so there will be limited details available prior to getting into the game.  Minor historical figures were not culled this time, which makes it easier to see relationships.

Current population in year 600:

	1521 Dwarves
	2353 Humans
	705 Elves
	50393 Goblins
	1560 Kobolds

	Total: 56532

I've adjusted my world generation settings in an attempt to create more stand-alone continents / islands.  There are also lots more titans and megabeasts, which means a lot more danger and a lot more sites that got wiped out.  That's an attempt to balance out the size of world history (now only 600 years), overall population and the complexity of the world while still using a medium sized world.
