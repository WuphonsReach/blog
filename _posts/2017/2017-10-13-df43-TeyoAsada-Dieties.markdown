#### Dieties

- Tobul Ochremine, deity: minerals
- Limar, deity: wealth
- Rodem, deity: metals, fire, the sun, nature, the rain
- Avuz the Blue Saffron, deity: jewels
- The Help of Gates, deity: fortresses
- Erib the Tower of Fountains, deity: mountains, volcanos

So, a small diety list compared to some fortresses (I've had up to 10).  Rodem is possibly the most interesting of the bunch.
