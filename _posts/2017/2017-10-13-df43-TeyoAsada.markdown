Re-rolling again... I really miss "Dan, The Glittering Sparkles" as a diety and I've rolled along too many years in the last world without keeping track of what is going on.  That's made me feel disconnected.  So back we go to the world generator!

Welcome to Teyo Asada (The World of Vision), year 396.  This is a [medium sized custom generated world](/blog/imgs/df/TeyoAsada/legends/region1-world_gen_param.txt) for Dwarf Fortress 43.05.  History is hidden by default, so there will be limited details available prior to getting into the game.  Minor historical figures were not culled this time, which makes it easier to see relationships.

{% include gallery id="gallerymap2" %}

Current population is extremely healthy in the year 396:

	8921 Dwarves
	11872 Humans
	6892 Elves
	23501 Goblins
	3042 Kobolds

	Total: 54228

I've adjusted my world generation settings in an attempt to create more stand-alone continents / islands.  There are also lots more titans and megabeasts, which means a lot more danger and a lot more sites that got wiped out.  That's an attempt to balance out the size of world history, overall population and the complexity of the world while still using a medium sized world.  Mineral scarcity got a bump from ~1100 down to ~800 which will make metals more frequent.

This map is from [Legends Browser](https://github.com/robertjanetzko/LegendsBrowser) and shows where the existing sites are located, colored by civilization.  There are minor spoilers here because Kobold caves are not usually displayed on the Dwarf Fortress map.

Necromancer towers are a bit limited on this map (only two), but maybe some more will spring up over time?

Key:

- Red: Goblins
- Orange: Dwarves
- Green: Elves
- Blue: Humans
- Purple: Necromancers
- Black: Kobolds

#### Dwarven Civilizations

As noted above, because I started with sixty civilizations on the map, a lot of the dwarves have survived.

Western

- The Hall of Mists
- The Enchanted Glazes)
- The Relic of Impunity (possibly going extinct)
- The Holy Glazes

Northwest

- The Shield of Pleating

Eastern

- The Allied Relic
- The Dreamy Wall
- The Sizzling Lashes (extinct)
- The Sandaled Board
- The Doors of Reason

Northeast

- The Bridge of Burning
- The Glorious Oars
- The Seals of Celebrating
- The Legendary Castle

#### The Dreamy Wall

This name catches my eye, so let's take a look at how it's doing.  The civilization has a current king who has ruled for over 110 years.  The current list of sites are:

- Orbssalve (fortress): pop 196 dwarves, 27 goblins, 13 elves
- Craftedclean (hillocks): pop 113 dwarves
- Paintedname (fortress): pop 186 dwarves, 28 goblins, 9 humans

The king is currently Urdim Shipstrong (living in Paintedname), born 262, became king in 282 at age 20.  At an age of 134, he's getting ancient but still participated in the The Festival of Caves footrace in year 391 (his son won in 383).  His wife, Cog Walllives, passed away in 343 after bearing four sons.  Three of the sons (Rovod, Sigun, Tirist) have survived to date and one (Rovod) has married and has three daughters (Ubbul, Eral, Vabok).  

Dieties

- Tobul Ochremine, deity: minerals
- Limar, deity: wealth
- Rodem, deity: metals, fire, the sun, nature, the rain
- Avuz the Blue Saffron, deity: jewels
- The Help of Gates, deity: fortresses
- Erib the Tower of Fountains, deity: mountains, volcanos

So, a small diety list compared to some fortresses (I've had up to 10).  Rodem is possibly the most interesting of the bunch.

#### Initial Embark

Our embark location will be a bit north of Girderrealm (an empty site of The Sizzling Lashes) by the Savegall brook in the Plain of Blood.  It will have sand, a small soil layer, shallow metal, deep metals and flux stone.  I'm hoping to also find shallow magma, but it's not a guarantee.  I like to have an embark size of 4x4 so that I have options.  The home fortress is a fair ways to the southwest on the other side of the eastern mountains.

Fortress name: Uzol Og (Oil of Clubs)
Group name: Utharuzol Og (The First Oil of Clubs)
Symbol: The Clasps of Roughness (image of a circle and stones)

Preparations:

- 3 picks, 1 battle axe, 1 iron anvil
- 10 of each of the four types of dwarven drink
- 10 pig tail and plump helmet seeds, 5 of the others
- 2 thread, 2 rope, 2 cloth
- 5 gypsum powder
- 1 each of various 2 point meats (about 15-25 pieces, different animals)
- 4 copper bars, 30 pieces of gabbro

Skills:

- Three miners
- One woodcutter
- One dwarf with no item preferences boosted with social skills (probable mayor is Fath Ezumsosh)

Animals:

- 2 female / 2 male dogs
- 2 female / 2 male cats
- 3 female / 2 male pigs
- 3 female / 2 male turkeys
- 3 female / 2 male peacocks

At this point, I have about 230 points left.  I spend about 130 points on training up three of the dwarves (not miner / wood cutter) with armor / shield / archery / dodge / teacher skills.

The rest I spend on copper bars (ended up with ten).  That will let me create armor for the two dwarves with military training quickly.

#### First steps

Immediately pause and issue some orders:

- `o-m` to turn off mixing of things in the same barrel/pot/bag
- `o-h` so that only farmers harvest
- `o-r-o-v` to gather refuse from outside (and get vermin cleaned up)
- `o-F` and turn off everything except "Claim your dead"
- `o-W` and turn off collection of webs
- `o-z` and set fishing to zone-only
