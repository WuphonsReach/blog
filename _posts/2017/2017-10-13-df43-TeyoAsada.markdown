Re-rolling again... I really miss "Dan, The Glittering Sparkles" as a diety and I've rolled along too many years in the last world without keeping track of what is going on.  That's made me feel disconnected.  So back we go to the world generator!

Welcome to Teyo Asada (The World of Vision), year 396.  This is a [medium sized custom generated world](/blog/imgs/df/TeyoAsada/legends/region1-world_gen_param.txt) for Dwarf Fortress 43.05.  History is hidden by default, so there will be limited details available prior to getting into the game.  Minor historical figures were not culled this time, which makes it easier to see relationships.

{% include gallery id="gallerymap2" %}

Current population is extremely healthy in the year 396:

	8921 Dwarves
	11872 Humans
	6892 Elves
	23501 Goblins
	3042 Kobolds

	Total: 54228

I've adjusted my world generation settings in an attempt to create more stand-alone continents / islands.  There are also lots more titans and megabeasts, which means a lot more danger and a lot more sites that got wiped out.  That's an attempt to balance out the size of world history, overall population and the complexity of the world while still using a medium sized world.  Mineral scarcity got a bump from ~1100 down to ~800 which will make metals more frequent.

This map is from [Legends Browser](https://github.com/robertjanetzko/LegendsBrowser) and shows where the existing sites are located, colored by civilization.  There are minor spoilers here because Kobold caves are not usually displayed on the Dwarf Fortress map.

Necromancer towers are a bit limited on this map (only two), but maybe some more will spring up over time?

Key:

- Red: Goblins
- Orange: Dwarves
- Green: Elves
- Blue: Humans
- Purple: Necromancers
- Black: Kobolds

#### Dwarven Civilizations

As noted above, because I started with sixty civilizations on the map, a lot of the dwarves have survived.

Western

- The Hall of Mists
- The Enchanted Glazes)
- The Relic of Impunity (possibly going extinct)
- The Holy Glazes

Northwest

- The Shield of Pleating

Eastern

- The Allied Relic
- The Dreamy Wall
- The Sizzling Lashes (extinct)
- The Sandaled Board
- The Doors of Reason

Northeast

- The Bridge of Burning
- The Glorious Oars
- The Seals of Celebrating
- The Legendary Castle

#### The Dreamy Wall

This name catches my eye, so let's take a look at how it's doing.  The civilization has a current king who has ruled for over 110 years.  The current list of sites are:

- Orbssalve (fortress): pop 196 dwarves, 27 goblins, 13 elves
- Craftedclean (hillocks): pop 113 dwarves
- Paintedname (fortress): pop 186 dwarves, 28 goblins, 9 humans

The king is currently Urdim Shipstrong (living in Paintedname), born 262, became king in 282 at age 20.  At an age of 134, he's getting ancient but still participated in the The Festival of Caves footrace in year 391 (his son won in 383).  His wife, Cog Walllives, passed away in 343 after bearing four sons.  Three of the sons (Rovod, Sigun, Tirist) have survived to date and one (Rovod) has married and has three daughters (Ubbul, Eral, Vabok).
