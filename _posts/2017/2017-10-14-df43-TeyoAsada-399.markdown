## Spring 399

Start of another year.  The sun-well has been floored over and a perimeter wall has been started.  This means I can start building out the first level of the sun-well with industry.

The elves have yet to bring anything interesting such as black bears or grizzly bears.

The Forgotten Beast, Maga Boradoto, has come.  A moderately worrisome beast, but at least it only has a poison sting and not a breath weapon.

Ilral Kekimber has given birth again to a girl, Oddom Geshudmeban.  Her husband, Tun Uznil feels adoration and is blissful at becoming again at the age of sixty-one.  Ilral is fify-nine years old.  If they keep this up, I'm going to have a population explosion in a few years.

Ilral Kekimber is now the bookkeeper and manager of the fortress.

## Autumn 399

The liason brings news.

Oarrein, reclaimed by The Clear Bodices (leader Arceth Imagerivers, mayor Ratha Chilledsour).

The mass-slaughter of animals has started.  It will probably take 2-3 years to catch up.
