The caravan has arrived on the 17th of Limestone (month 7).  I've been making spiked wooden balls and stone mechanisms (about two to three dozen of each) for trading because it's fast and easy.  Turkey poults have hatched and the peachicks should not be far behind.  For food and drink, I am relying on herbalism collection of plants from the surface and the butchered remains of the draft animals.

The first migration wave consisted of three dwarves (Sakzul Tathtatzaneg, Asen Lertethvutok, Onget Asumer) bringing Uzol Og up to ten dwarves.  

Sakzul is married to Onget (husband), and Asen is her mother.  They have two deceased sons and one surviving daughter.  All three immigrated from the Paintedname fortress.

I have the population limit set at 15 for now because I don't want a huge population while I'm digging out and roofing over the "sun well".  Plus I want to construct the perimeter walls, and dig out the western portion of the main crossroads below.

Right now, all the important jobs (masonry, cooking, brewing, carpenter, etc.) are assigned to three or four dwarves out of the ten in a random fashion.  Everyone is a hauler, everyone has three or four professions to be worked as needed.

Fath Ezumsosh (one of the original seven) has become the expedition leadere as planned.  She is the dwarf that I gave high social skills to on the embark screen.

The liason from The Dreamy Wall is the baron-consort Sibrek Icepaint (b 241).  As far as I know, the king is still alive as is his wife (Udil), so I'm not sure how he has the position of consort.

On the news front:

- Atticdusk has been reclaimed by The Hazy Trumpet (The Dreamy Wall), led by Ritho Bronzecyclone.  The mayor is Spen Lutepulled.
- Slaplances has been reclaimed by The Dipped City (The Dreamy Wall), led by Erod Wipeheavens.  The mayor is Artum Palmwaax.

Looking at the legends export, I suspect that Atticdusk will not last long as the hydra, Cafafi Phlegmcomet the Pulpy Yells, routed the place in 381 and probably is still there.  The Slaplances site is more likely to succeed as it was routed in year 45 by a roc, Dalzat Greatestrobust the Hawk of Clams, that has since moved on to attack Bannerfair (The Allied Relic) hillocks in 383.

The plan for the rest of the year is to keep digging into the earth, keep harvesting surface plants, keep brewing and keep breeding animals.

Three more dwarves have arrived on the 9th of Sandstone (month 8).

- Tun Uznil (husband of Ilral, grandson of Sibrek the baron-consort)
- Tholtig Atheldakas (niece of Ilral)
- Ilral Kekimber (wife of Tun, niece of Asen Lertethvutok)
