## Spring 411

Nil Votokfeb has been drafted to replace the deceased Tholtig Atheldaka.  Nil already has level 4 armor skills and has the highest armor skill of anyone in the fortress.

The only caravan that I'm really interested in this year is the elves, if they bring a male grizzly bear.

I'll still probably do light trading with the humans and dwarves, but I'm drowning in roasts at the moment and behind on a lot of hauling.

Stinthad and Endok have had slabs engraved, but were not well-known enough to warrant pride of place.  So their slabs will be placed next to their tombs.  Tholtig Atheldaka, a faithful worshiper of [Erib the Tower of Fountains]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017/2017-10-13-df43-TeyoAsada-Dieties %}), will have hers placed in the temple.
