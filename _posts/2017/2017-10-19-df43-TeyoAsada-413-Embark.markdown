## Embark (Autumn 413)

Going to embark at a new location, east of Uzol Og, still in the Plain of Blood.  Going downstream to try and find a different set of metals by straddling two biomes.  This will be a tiny 2x2 embark along a stream called, "Th Prmnncy-Rt of Mst" (the permanency route of mist?).

{% include gallery id="gallerymap1" %}

There's really steep cliffs in the northeast portion of this sector.  I may have to embark there for the next fortress.

#### Group

Site: Logemsamam (Paintcourage)

Group: Tetothlor (The Lone Tool)

- Lokum Muthkatedan (Miner)
- Adil Oltaratol (Miner)
- Melbil Bomrekuvel (Miner)
- Erith Vucarziril (Woodcutter)
- Stukos Amostuzol (Expedition Leader)
- Inod Astolon (Peasant)
- Thob Inethdodok (Peasant)

Preparations are very similar to my [previous embark]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017/2017-10-13-df43-TeyoAsada-396-Embark %}), except with more skill points given to the initial seven dwarves.

#### Embark Map

One of the first things I do in any zone where I think I may have freezing ice is to mark all of the water tiles as restricted.  While dfHack has the `restrictliquids` command, it only works on the under-surface tiles.  It does not also place restrictions on the ground level tiles.  You'd have to wait for freezing weather and then use `restrictice`.

{% include gallery id="gallerymap2" %}

Since this is a more compact site, I'm trying a more compact design as well.  I'm still going to do a sun-well, but will only make it about 11x25.  I will probably put the training area on top of the sun-well since it is close to the entrance ramp.

Of course, while I'm just starting to dig out, the dwarven caravan arrives.  I have no trade depot and nothing to trade yet, so I'm just going to have to build a depot and then deconstruct it to rob them.

I'll make it up to them in future years with massive profits.

#### Migrants

- Kivish Gembishamost
- Edem Abirfikod
- Erush Alakfikod
- Aban Sedurushat
- Etur Uzoluvar
- Tobul Tadiokum (child)
- Bembul Olonimaz (child)
- Kib Amuddakost (child)

Most of those are from Oil of Clubs.  If any of them arrived with armor, they're going in a militia squad right away to deal with the wildlife.

## Spring 414

Huzzah, the elves have brought me a Grizzly Bear already.

## Summer 414

{% include gallery id="gallerymap3" %}

The walls are up around the entrance.  Made of wood for the moment until I can construct enough rock blocks and take time to replace them.

The wildlife is merely annoying.  I have a handful of weapon traps at choke points to keep it down to a dull nuicance.

Humans from Gil Gocta have arrived.  Traded for a few things like leather, cloth, and some meat/fish.

## Autumn 414

Orbsalve has fallen, conquered by The Sins of Gilding (as expected).

Mistem Salvsneaked is now the mayor of The First Oil of Clubs, replacing Rigoth Shortrock.

Starting work on the outer permiter wall, but I don't expect to finish it until 416-417.

## Spring 415

Huzzah again.  The elves brought another grizzly bear.  It's a second female.  Hopefully they bring me a male next year so I can start breeding them.

## Autumn 415

Still only 15 dwarves in the fortress.

## Winter 415

Kib Amuddakost has grown up to be a peasant.

## Spring 417

Not much has happened the last two years.  It's been 15 dwarves, digging out lodgings for more.  

Possible baron appointments (based on preferences):

- Kib Amuddakost (windows)
- Stukos Amostuzol (totems)

Kib will probably get the nod as windows are basically free if you have sand on the embark.  She's also really young, so could hold the position for many years.

No useful critters in the elven caravan this year.

## Autumn 418

Jumping forward a lot of seasons at a time here because nothing of interest is happening other then building walls / constructions.  Nor am I allowing new migrants (which might be a long-term mistake).

The current outpost liason is Zulban Thadkel from Nazomadil.

## Spring 419

Elves brought a grizzly bear again.  I hope this one is a male (to go with the two females that I already have).

It is! It is a male!

Now hopefully it's not shy about breeding with the two female grizzlies.

Also, Bembul Olonimaz has grown to become a peasant.

## Winter 419

One of the grizzly bears has given birth to a cub!

Still digging out granite to turn into blocks for the outer walls.  Trading with the caravans for things like berries, steel and iron, along with cloth/silk/yarn when possible.

With only 15 dwarves, the work proceeds slowly but safely.

There are six dwarves in the militia, which trains three at a time during the winter season.

- Inod Astolon
- Thob Inethdodok
- Stukos Amostuzol
- Kib Amuddakost
- Erith Vucarziril
- Etur Uzoluvar

All six are competent or better dodgers, but the armor user skill is taking a while to train up.  Discipline, student and observer skills are all dabbling.  I may have to boost training to 4+ at a time to see if more training gets organized during the winter.

## Autumn 421

Erush Alakfikod gave birth to a girl, Cog Ustutheral.  The father is Kivish Gembishamost.

Tobul Tadiokum will grow up soon to be a peasant.  That brings us to fifteen working dwarves, plus the dwarven baby.
