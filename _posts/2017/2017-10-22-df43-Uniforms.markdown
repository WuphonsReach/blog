## Royal Guard Uniform

The "Royal Guard" squad has been promoted to all steel and silk armor.  Naturally, this makes them a bit slow at moving around.  Here's the uniform:

- (19u) steel mail shirts
- (16u) steel breastplates
- (3u) 3x silk cloaks
- (7u) steel helms
- (<1u) 3x silk hoods
- (1u) silk trousers
- (22u) steel greaves
- (<1u) silk gloves
- (2u) steel gauntlets
- (6u) steel high boots
- (<1u) wood shields
- (3u) steel crossbows

Plus the extras that they carry:

- (6u) quiver with 25-50 bolts, each bolt is 1u
- (8u) flask

That gives a Royal Guard uniform weight of 121u to 146u.

## Militia Uniform

Compare that to the new militia uniform:

- (2u-8u) 2x cloaks (leather 1u, cloth 4u)
- (7u) metal helms
- (<1u) 2x hoods
- (1u) trousers
- (1u) leather armor
- (1u) leather leggings
- (<1u) gloves
- (2u) metal gauntlets
- (6u) metal high boots
- (<1u) wood shields
- (3u) copper crossbows

Which is only a Militia uniform weight of 64u, up to 93u.  If I prevent them from carrying flasks, I save up to 8u of weight.  Limiting them to leather or silk cloaks would save another 6u of weight.
