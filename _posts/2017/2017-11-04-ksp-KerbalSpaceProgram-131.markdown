During the period of March-October, I tend to get really busy with work.  Which is why I stepped away from KSP for a while.  Plus I was waiting on the 1.3 release, and for at least one bug-fix release after that (i.e. 1.3.1).

Because I was having issues with my blog, I also started posting in the KSP forums instead of here:

- [ScrapyardBob's 1.0.5 career](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128939-scrapyardbobs-105-career/) from Dec-2015
- [ScrapyardBob's KSP 1.2 Career - Dec 2016](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154032-scrapyardbobs-ksp-12-career-dec-2016-image-heavy)

There's a lot of useful information in those links, plus lots of lovely 4k resolution images and other things.
