One of the things I like to do in my KSP career saves is to give each ship that gets launched an unique serial number.  The format is "XXX-YYDD" where:

- XXX is the vessel type / purpose / size
- YY is a 2-letter code indicating the launch year
- DD is a 2-letter code indicating the launch day

This gives me vessel names like:

- ST1-ANDW
- CRV7-AJFA

In general, I assign the ship a serial number on the day that it gets rolled out to the pad for launch.  But sometimes (because I use KCT), I will assign ship serials as I queue them up for being built.

Some of my vessels get more permanent names as well, like 'Alpha' or 'Deimos'.  But the serial numbers are still embedded in the name.
