Just a few screenshots from year 17.

The lighting on this was just about perfect for a stock atmosphere / stock graphics besides RealPlume.

Two-drill surface harvester heading to the Mun to pull up RareMetals and ExoticMinerals.  It is using the 3.75m square Kontainer.

This is the [Bluedog Design Bureau (CobaltWolf)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/122020-131-bluedog-design-bureau-stockalike-saturn-apollo-and-more-v131-%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B0-14oct2017/) equivalent of NASA's Apollo capsule.  It holds three kerbals in the base design and five in an upgraded design.  With [RPM](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105821-131-rasterpropmonitor-still-putting-the-a-in-iva-v0292-18-october-2017/), [ASET](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116430-aset-props-pack-v15-for-the-modders-who-create-iva/) and [kOS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/61827-13-kos-scriptable-autopilot-system-v1130/) installed, the center console can hold lots of interactive screens.  That makes it possible to do about 99% of your flight from the eyes of the center kerbal. 

Due to the IVA in this pod, along with the 2.5m size, it's quickly becoming my workhorse for crew-return vehicles when I only want to send up 3 or 5.

I have moved the 'Bravo' station core into a 45km orbit around the Mun.  It has no crew at the moment, but that will be rectified sometime in Y18 or Y19.  I have to get it stocked with supplies / fertilizer, plus get a lander module in place, and test out the transfer vehicle that gets crew from the Kerbin station to the Mun station.  First task after flag planting will be to disassemble all of the excess mining rigs in the Mun's Midlands site.

The initial expansion module for 'Alpha' station at Kerbin is also under construction.
