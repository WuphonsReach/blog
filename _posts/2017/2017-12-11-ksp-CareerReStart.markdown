Things really got whacked out in my previous career save.  I've gone back and simplified my install, killed off any add-ons that were throwing exceptions, and re-installed some things.  The Scrapyard add-on is one of those that got the boot, it causes too much lag in the VAB/SPH editors after you get a long career going.  We'll call this career, "KSP17G".

I've also tweaked some things in the [Kerbal Construction Time (KCT) preset]((/blog/imgs/ksp/2017/SYBSlower.cfg)) that I use.  One major change is that if you are researching multiple science nodes at the same time, the first node gets 100% of the rate, the second node gets 1/2 the rate, the third node running gets 1/3 the rate, etc.  So unlock your nodes in the order of priority.

Still giving myself 8000 science to start and 25 million in funds for unlocks, building upgrades, and getting moderately deep within the tech tree quickly.

I plan on installing Deep Freeze (cryogenics for Kerbals on long-duration) missions as well.

Near Future Electrical is installed, so reactors and RTGs now have lifespans.  But it also triggers a bug where if you have both reactors and drills/converters (both stock and USI) on the same vessel, the reactor will overheat.  That means, for heavy mining, I have to either use USI PDUs (with an engineer) and the microwave link to transmit power, or lots of expensive RTGs, or very large battery banks combined with solar panels.

The first 10 years are usually dedicated to getting a communication network up around Kerbin, Mun and Minmus.  Including unlocking the tier 3 relay antenna (RA-15) to support communication to most planets in the stock solar system.
