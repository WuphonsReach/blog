Y14-D112 - Landed the first automated miner (AM1 series) at the Mun's Farside Crater.  It has three of the "Drill-O-Matic Junior" harvesters, each pulling about 0.034 ore/sec.  The local ore concentration is 11.33% (drills are rated at 0.3 ore/sec with 100% concentration).

According to the catch-up mechanics, I should put 12 hours worth of ore storage on the unit.

    12 hrs * 3 drills * 0.034 ore/sec * 3600 sec = 4406 ore/12h

Instead, I only have 3000 ore storage (3.75m Kontainer Tank - Flat).  The Material Processing Unit (MPU) is running at 39% load, converting ore to LF/Ox.  So it's not an ideal design and maybe I should have a bit more ore storage on board.

But the AM1's purposes are:

- Relatively lightweight (17t landed)
- A pathfinder, to check local ore concentrations
- Fulfill the ISRU contracts for harvesting ore
- Create a small planetary stockpile of LF/Ox

It's also time to rotate the crew of 'Alpha' station (who launched during year 12, about 1.5 years ago).  

Mission tasks are:

- Hire two new scientists (Obfen and Nebas)
- Take up one engineer (Deblock) and two scientists (Obfen and Nebas)
- Visit 'Bravo' station in LKO
- Disassembly of refueling vessels at 'Bravo' into Material Kits
- Final preparations for 'Bravo' to be moved to the Mun's orbit
- Travel to 'Alpha' station in LKO
- Perform crew swap
- Return year 12 crew
