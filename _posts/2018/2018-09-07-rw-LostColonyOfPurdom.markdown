Now that [RimWorld](https://steamcommunity.com/app/294100/workshop/) beta 19 is officially out, I've switched from playing unstable to the stable branch.  While the beta 19 is very good, even without any mods, I wanted to switch over to using some [mods](https://steamcommunity.com/app/294100/workshop/) that I pinned during the last month.  I really like tribal starts with five colonists and the lack of electricity or advanced technology.  I like having about 25-30 pawns at the upper end.  I'm also still learning, so I tend to start on lower difficulties.  

{% include gallery id="gallery1" %}

- Seed: "`red bull bluff`"
- Coverage: 100% (with average rain/temp)

The year is 5500, the colony is starting in an unnamed temperate forest near "Old Hot Lenwasnabum", and the following factions:

- Blue Polar Bear (neutral, yellow tents): Guban (SW) and White Gorge (NE)
- Rogues (hostile, dark red skull): Night Oasis
- Ouen (neutral, light purple house): Cardsshaw (NE)
- Purple Chincilla Banzo (hostile, green tents): Legua Gorge (NW)
- Torture Pack (hostile, light red skull): Mortar's Crag (NW)

There are a total of ten factions on the map: two neutral tribal, two hostile tribal, two hostile pirate, two neutral outlander, and two hostile outlander.  

{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

We've settled in a place with permanent summer as the climate.  So growing season is year-round which makes it a really easy map.  Cold snaps are unlikely or impossible which is good for tribal colonies with limited clothing options at the start.  There's lots of hills which give natural walls and choke-points for defense.  There's a brook, but the only deep water for fishing is on the other side of a hill.  The brook is wide enough to provide water-based power generation later once I unlock watermills.

Between the two geothermal vents and the ability to put maybe half-a-dozen watermills in place, I'll have little need for windmills / solar panels / batteries.

{% include gallery id="gallery3" %}

The colonists consist of a pair of siblings, plus a fifth colonist.

- Doc (M, 38) and Zoci (M, 35)
- Green (F, 22, Zoci's lover) and Puma (M, 26)
- Lotus (F, 29)

I don't know whether Zoci/Green are a stable pairing, or if others will occur yet.  I've installed the [Psychology](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1499800980) mod, so this could be a harmonious ride or a wild dark ride.

Some first steps that I need to take:

- Roof over the two nearby structures, install wooden walls and wood doors.
- Setup a cooking table, butcher table, crafting spot.
- Setup indoor stockpiles for hides, pemmican, herbal meds.
- Plant 5x5 corn, 5x10 rice, 5x5 potato, 5x5 strawberry patches
- Only have a single hunter to start (Lotus), hunt only as-needed to avoid waste

I like to identify one to three 11x11 squares which can later be roofed over for a sun lamp if needed.  There's a bit of rich soil to the west side of a small hill where I can put a pair of 11x11 planning markers (Order -> Plan).  To the west of that is a big mud patch, on top of which I'll build housing.  

I don't actually have strawberry fields to start with, because [VGP Vegetable Garden](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1185265132) hides that until later.  But I have corn, barley (from VGP), potato, and rice.  Barley is blight-resistant, but I think putting up walls between the plots controls the spreading of blight.

5501 Apr 1st -- The first year went quick, Green and Zoci are now engaged to be married.  Been surviving on simple meals made from hunted meats until the harvests come in and we can start putting away pemmican for long-term storage.  That's working okay, because I need the leathers to make bedrolls and tribal garb.

5501 Apr 4th -- A grizzly bear decided to hunt our pet dog (Bogdan-Kun, bonded to Green) and had to be killed.  Puma was injured during the melee and Bogdan-Kun is now missing a front-left paw.  Bear meat is on the menu!  But also, getting a perimeter wall up is something we should tackle this year.

{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

5501 Apr 5th -- Starting on the individual bedrooms.  We have lots and lots of meat that will spoil, but no veggies with which to make pemmican.  The land is bountiful enough with wildlife that I'm not too worried.  Bedrolls for the single colonists have been made, but they're still sleeping in a barracks room.  Loci and Green do have a couple's suite, but
no bedroll yet.

5501 Apr 13th -- Well, that was quick.  Zoci and Green broke up due to talking about each other.  Expecting Lotus and Doc to be the next possible pairing, but their jobs are quite different (Lotus is always out hunting), so I don't know for sure.  (Later on I realized that Doc has a Kinsey rating of six and would not be interested.)

5501 Jul 3rd -- Heatwave, 40-42C during the day.  Passive coolers for all the indoor spaces are enough to deal with the heat.  This is a very temperate area of the map with very moderate temperature swings.  The heatwaves do chase almost all the critters off the map, so there's nothing to hunt for a few days.

5501 Jul 5th -- Puma and Doc caught the Flu.  That's two of the three medics, Green will have to treat the two of them.  It's also both of the cooks; we'll be living off pemmican for a few days.

5501 Jul 8th -- Transport pod crash brings us Aerin (F, 22, Ouen faction) with a strong artistic intrest and moderate intrest in medical, social and intellectual.  Puma has recovered from the flu and Doc will be cured in about a day.  Even after they are up and walking around, it takes a day or two for the effects of flu to wear off.

5501 Jul 12th -- Zoci and Green are lovers again.  And Aerin is leaving the map.  That's a shame because she would have been useful.  It gives us a +16 to relations with Ouen.

5501 Sep 1st -- Tomoko (F, 62) being chased by Torture Pack pirates has been granted asylum.  She won't do dumb labor, but she can sit and research.  Zoci rejected Green's marriage proposal (it's a very hot/cold relationship).  Green then proposed again on the same day and now they are no longer a couple.  Possibly a small bug in the Psychology mod that they don't stop sharing a bed after a break-up.

5501 Sep 5th -- Zoci and Green got into a big fight.  Green still likes Zoci (+13), but Zoci really dislikes Green (-31) now.  Doc and Puma are thick as thieves (+100 to each other).  Doc has a Kinsey rating of 6 (very homosexual) while Puma has a rating of 0 (very heterosexual); so nothing should develop there.  Might see Puma and Lotus get together as they are liking each other more over time.

5501 Sep 7th -- A bulk goods caravan arrives from Orange Meadow Confederation with the grandfather (Tasca) of Zoci and Doc.

5501 Sep 14th -- Three colonists come down with the plague: Tomoko, Zoci and Lotus.  Tomoko is completely bed-ridden.

5501 Dec 2nd -- Puma and Lotus are now lovers.  Tomoko developed immunity to the plague, but is still bed-ridden.

5501 Dec 4th -- Transport pod crash brings Quinn (M, 22, refugee) to the colony.  Incapable of skilled labor, he'll make a good hauler.

5501 Dec 11th -- Lotus and Puma are now engaged.

5502 Apr 2nd -- Lotus and Tomoko are stricken with malaria.  Zoci and Green are lovers again.

5502 Apr 7th -- Lotus and Puma get married.

5502 Apr 10th -- Green proposed to Zoci, and Zoci rejected her again.  They have broken up.
