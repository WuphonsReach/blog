- Seed: "`red green`"
- Coverage: 100% (with average rain/temp)
- Storyteller: Phoebe (2x mod), base builder

Faction names tend to differ across world generation (possibly based on some of the mods I have installed), but the world itself is identical in placement of rivers, mountains, biomes.

Initial tribe members:

- Rasen (M, 21): construction/medical
- Lema (F, 43): cooking/crafting
- Choxi (F, 19): shooting/mining
- Blue (F, 33): shooting
- Gaz (F, 35): n/a

5500 Sep 3rd -- Owl (F, 72) joins.  She has a son, Red Gara (faction leader).  No strong passions, but some interest in cooking/plants/social.

5500 Sep 10th -- Rasen and Lema are now about -50 to each other (rivals).  Blue and Rasen are not too fond of each other either, but it's only about -10.

5500 Sep 11th -- Captured Lu (F, 38).  Very good with animals.  However, she's missing a leg from the fighting (had to be cut off) and has a nasty infection.  She passed away just before midnight.

5500 Sep 14th -- Eddie (M, 45) is being chased by Green Ox Legua.  We've offered refuge.

5500 Dec 9th -- Eddie is a sickly man and has come down with the plague.

5501 Apr 12th -- Fedosia (F, 18) is running from The Terrorists and has been offered refuge.  

5501 Jul 9th -- Mullins (M, 38) landed in a pod nearby.  Another night-owl with strong cooking interest and some skill in medical/social.  He left the map after being healed.

5501 Jul 13th -- Eddie has caught malaria.  We imprisoned Beve (M, 38) from Orange Cobra Ulovelan.  His traits are nervous+beautiful. 

5501 Sep 2nd -- Eddie catches gut-worms.  Then he comes down with sensory mechanites a few hours later.

5501 Sep 3rd -- 1st Mayoral Election: Gaz and Lema are running for office.  Lema wins on Sep 10th with five votes.

5501 Sep 6th -- Fedosia told Eddie a tale about vomiting and now they are lovers.  She's half his age...

5501 Sep 9th -- Eddie comes down with the plague.  

5501 Dec 3rd -- Eddie comes down with the flu.  Cold-snap has started.  This was a 50/60 growing season spot on the world map with temperatures never supposed to get below +5C.  It got down to about -17C overnight, down to -19C a few nights later.

5501 Dec 10th -- Detre (M, 45), being chased by Buffalo Men faction, is offered refuge.  There's also muffalo on the map, so it's time to go group-hunting.

5502 Apr 1st -- Eddie proposed to Fedosia, but she refused.  A short run-down of the colonists:

- Rasen (M, 23): No strong opinions towards anyone.  Strong interest in construction(15) and medical(7).  He is a psychopath.

- Eddie (M, 46): Sickly and pacifist.  Gets along with most.  No strong interests; effective at plants(13) and social(10).
- Fedosia (F, 19): A wimp and slothful.  Likes all but Rasen (-31).  No strong work interest, mostly does construction (10).
