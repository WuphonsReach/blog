- Seed: "`three tail avenger`"
- Coverage: 100% (with average rain/temp)
- Storyteller: Phoebe (2x mod), base builder (ramped up later)

Faction names tend to differ across world generation (possibly based on some of the mods I have installed), but the world itself is identical in placement of rivers, mountains, biomes.  Settling in a hilly/mountainous region with a river, south part of the Xadagua Forest.  Growing season is 50/60 days, so it's a warmer than average temperate forest location.

This will be started right after 1.0 releases, so I know I won't have some of the usual mods (Quarry for one).


Initial tribe members:

- Misu (F, 21), undergrounder/masochist, with moderate skill at mining/crafting/art.
- Maka (F, 36), nimble/cannibal, with strong shooting interest and moderate cooking/medical interest.
- Honani (M, 56), brother of Maka, ascetic, strong cooking/medical interest.
- Kamama (F, 57), ascetic/steadfast, strong animals, moderate mining/cooking/plants/intellectual.
- Hakuja (F, 49), lover of Honani, lazy/psychically deaf, strong medical, moderate plants.

This leaves me a little weak on social, but is enough to start.

5500 Jul 14th: Offered refuge to Mila (F, 37) who is running away from Marty's Owls.  She's a bloodlusty night owl, with strong interest in cooking/plants.

5500 Sep 14th: Offer refuge to Beryl (F, 35), being chased by Shiv Goblins.  A sanguine brawler with strong social/intellectual interest.

5500 Sep 15th: Honari/Hakuja get engaged.
