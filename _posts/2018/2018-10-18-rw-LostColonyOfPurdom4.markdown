Restarting with a new colony now that Rimworld 1.0 is released and things should be stable for a long time.  I'm playing a heavily modded game, with semi-vanilla balance, but taking the rough edges off some things and adding some other things.  This will be the fourth attempt at the Lost Colony of Purdom (from the old Goon Show).

- Seed: "`red fox`"
- Coverage: 100% (with average rain/temp)
- Storyteller: Phoebe (2x mod), base builder (ramped up later)
- Scenario: Tribal start, zero techs.
- Location: Tevean Thicket (27.74S, 104.26W). Temperature range of 3C-31C, avg 17C.  40/60 growing days.

Faction names tend to differ across world generation (possibly based on some of the mods I have installed), but the world itself is identical in placement of rivers, mountains, biomes.  

{% include gallery id="gallery1" %}

## Key mod settings:

- Change Research Speed: 5.0x slower factor, with tech advance allowed.
- Rainbeau's Fertile Fields: 50% chance for plowed to degrade to rich, 30% for rich to degrade to normal.  Automatic plowing and hard mode is turned on.
- Rainbeau's Rational Romance: 60% straight, 15% bisexual, 15% gay, 10% asexual.
- Supply and Demand: 300%

The big effect is the research speed and starting with zero technologies, plus a tribal start making it all cost even more.  The passive cooler was 2000 and pemmican was 2500 to research.  A level 10 researcher is looking at 1/2 to 3/4 of a year to research something like passive cooler.  Unless I run multiple shifts per day and turn off all other jobs on the researcher.

## Starting tribe:

- Wen (F, 28), sister of Mapiya.  A quick sleeper with some interest in construction/mining.
- Mapiya (F, 16), sister of Wen.  A kind fast learner with strong melee interest and some construction/mining.
- Dyami (M, 35), husband of Wen.  Sanguine with some interest in construction/mining/art.
- Crag (M, 42), brother of Zebra.  Sanguine with some interest in cooking/plants.
- Zebra (M, 34), brother of Crag. Iron-willed night owl with some interest in plans and medical.

## 5500

**Dec 6th**: Paja (M, 26) wanders in and joins.  Kind, iron-willed, but with chemical fascination.  No strong skills.

## 5501

**Jul 1st**: Mitsuya (M, 18) wanders in and joins.  A depressive neurotic misogynist.  He's going to be lots of fun.  Won't do dumb labor and his only interest is construction.  Paja just got demoted to hauler/janitor.

**Jul 11th**: Three colonists come down with flu.

**Sep 12th**: I need to setup a caravan to haul all the excess of short bows and tribalwear to a nearby settlement.  I have sixty-seven awful quality and eighty-one poor quality short bows.  Five colonists (leaving Dyami and Wen behind) can carry about 170kg.  With six bedrolls and 1800 pemmican, that leaves me about 100kg for cargo, or about 180 bows.  Travel time to the Devotion District settlement of Lenlia Social League (LSL)) is about five days.

{% include gallery id="caravan5501" %}

**Sep 14th**: Our caravan meets up with a friendly caravan from Nalaneron.  Mapiya was able to trade everything for twelve incendiary shells and sixty silver.  Our caravan can turn around and come home.  At home, a small band of traders wandered past and we unloaded the rest of the good/normal quality short bows in exchange for buying a Heavy SMG and some silver.

**Dec 7th**: Mitsuya (M, 18), our resident neurotic, managed to have an accident and set the research room on fire.  That was nasty because the long house has wood walls (but ironwood floors) and lots of wood furniture.  I had to break open the side walls to the outside to keep temperatures low enough to fight the fire.  All of my colonists suffered at least small burns and Mitsuya got the worst of it.  (Note: The mod that causes small accidents is called [Annoying Life](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1439886892).)

**Dec 15th**: End of year snapshot

## 5502 

{% include gallery id="colonists5502" %}

**Jul 12th**: Mitsuya and Mapiya catch fibrous mechanites.

**Sep 13th**: Finished researching complex furniture.  Next up is stone-cutting (2250).

**Dec 5th**: Odina (F, 50) wanders in and joins.  A sickly psychopath that is also psychically deaf.  She'll be good training for the doctors.

## 5503

**Apr 9th**: Captured Alvin (M, 17) from The Monkey Men (TMM).  A pessimistic masochistic psychopath.  Modest doctoring skills and interest.

**Apr 11**: Finished stone-cutting.  Next is tree sowing (5000).

**Apr 7th**: Colony layout.  Hauling is a problem.

{% include gallery id="layout5504" %}

**Apr 9th**: Captured Nukpana (M, 16), who wandered into the colony about a year ago.  He's an ugly, slowpoke, ascetic and I've been ignoring him.  But now he's wandered into the main house and is being a nuisance.

**Apr 15th**: Tamed four alpaca and bought two huskies off the traders.  I need animals to train with to get handling skill up to 10-ish so that I can work with bears and wolves later.

**Jul 1st**: The first cold snap.  We've had a few heat waves, but never a cold snap.  Dropped down to -20C.  All of my colonists wear tribal-wear, which is only good down to about 2-5C.  On the 3rd, it gets down to -21C with a hard snow.  We got through it okay, with only a few cases of mild hypothermia.

**Jul 10th**: Paja/Time marriage.

**Sep 2nd**: Finished tree sowing, starting comfortable beds.

**Dec 4th**: Finished comfortable beds research, starting canning (VGP Vegetable Garden, 3750).

## 5505

**Jul 1st**: Cold snap, got down to -22C some nights.  Noticing that sometime Mapiya had her right eye crushed.

**Jul 7th**: Six colonists come down with flu.

**Jul 9th**: Purchased Sarah (F, 35) from The Coalition of the Godless Soil (TCotGS).  Sanguine, ascetic, jogger.  With strong research skill.  Also purchased Fjellsmel (M, 21), a tough sanguine cooking/mining lad.

**Sep 14th**: Mapiya/Fjellsmel become lovers.

**Dec 5th**: Finished canning table research, next is complex clothing (4500).

**Dec 11th**: A caravan from Lenlia Social League (LSL) stopped by and we traded away all of our excess furniture in exchange for allied status.  Even better, they brought along three telescopes.

**Dec 14th**: Silard (M, 45) joins after being rescued from a crash landed pod.  An abrasive, creepy breathing, steadfast, gay, pacifist.  Strong construction skills, strong mining interest and some construction interest.

## 5506

**Apr 13th**: Purchased a few people from the slavers.  Sora (M, 48), fast learner with interest in crafting, but a pacifist.  Suni (F, 16) a night-owl with artistic/intellectual interest.  Braz (M, 30) a quick-sleeping psychopathic night owl.  Jenni (F, 45) a pretty hard-worker.  That will give me a day and night shift working the research table.

**Jul 5th**: Mapiya/Fjellsmel get engaged.

**Jul 9th**: Nash (M, 29) from The Monkey Men (TMM) crash landed and has been captured.  He's an optimistic teetotaler.

**Jul 12th** Finished complex clothing research, next is cocoa (5000).

**Sep 7th**: Mapiya/Fjellsmel marriage.

**Dec 3rd**: Slavers come by again.  Andre (M, 48), fast learner / careful shooter.  Really strong interest in plants, animals, crafting, artistic and medical.  Also Nicole (F, 44), a hard worker with strong social skills.

**Dec 7th**: Six colonists come down with malaria.

**Dec 10th**: Odina turns 55 and now has a bad back.  Cocoa research finishes, going to do Agriculture I (2500) from Vegetable Garden.  Should take about half a year.

**Dec 13th** Isaias turns 25 and gains artery blockage.

## 5507

Production of shirts/pants has started.  Was already making cloth and alpaca wool tuques and jackets and plainleather dusters.

**Apr 2nd**: Captured Kim (F, 29), a wild woman who is an iron-willed teetotaler brawler.  Will not do dumb labor or cleaning, but has strong crafting interest.

**Apr 10th**: Finished the Agriculture I research after only a single quadrum (my guess was two quadrums).  Starting recurve bow (2000).

**Apr 11th**: Andrei/Sarah become lovers.

**Jul 5th**: Finished recurve bow research, next is Electricity (16000).  At a guess, that will take about 80 days (1.3 years).

**Jul 9th**: Cold snap (-24C as a low) kills all the crops (quickly, had no time to harvest).  Plus the ironwood grove has blight.  Trista (F, 16), an optimsistic and kind soul crashes nearby and is rescued.

**Sep 3rd**: Megasloth (M, 15) self-tames.  We shall name him Manny.

**Sep 5th**: Etch (M, 21) wanders in and joins.  Volatile / bloodlust / trigger-happy.
