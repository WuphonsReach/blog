Restarting with a new colony now that Rimworld 1.0 is released and things should be stable for a long time.  I'm playing a heavily modded game, with semi-vanilla balance, but taking the rough edges off some things and adding some other things.  This will be the fourth attempt at the Lost Colony of Purdom (from the old Goon Show).

- Seed: "`red river belt`"
- Coverage: 100% (with average rain/temp)
- Storyteller: Phoebe, base builder (ramped up later)
- Scenario: Tribal start (modified to provide starting pemmican).

Faction names tend to differ across world generation (possibly based on some of the mods I have installed), but the world itself is identical in placement of rivers, mountains, biomes.  

## Key mod settings:

- Change Research Speed: 5.0x slower factor, with no tech advance allowed.
- Rainbeau's Fertile Fields: 40% chance for plowed to degrade to rich, 20% for rich to degrade to normal.  Automatic plowing and hard mode is turned on.
- Rainbeau's Rational Romance: 60% straight, 15% bisexual, 15% gay, 10% asexual.
- Supply and Demand: 250%

The big effect is the research speed and starting with few technologies, plus a tribal start making it all cost even more.  The passive cooler was 2000 and pemmican was 2500 to research.  A level 10 researcher is looking at 1/2 to 3/4 of a year to research something like passive cooler.  Unless I run multiple shifts per day and turn off all other jobs on the researcher.

## Colony location:

Seler Forest (18.98S, 125.14W). Temperature range of 5C-26C, avg 15.5C.  40/60 growing days.

## Starting tribe:

- Razor (F, 53): Plants/Medical, mother of Waya.
- Waya (M, 28): Plants/Crafting, son of Razor.
- Otoah (M, 25): Cooking, brother of Eyota.
- Eyota (F, 31): Medical, sister of Otoah.
- Chitto (M, 50): Shooting.  Also a night-owl.

**Sep 1st**: One of the new mods to hit the scene is [Real Ruins](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1552146295), which uses shared data from player bases to generate more interesting abandoned buildings.  We have three double beds, flower pots and a handful of other goodies already on the map.

**Sep 6th**: Captured Tsoai (M, 15).  A gay cannibalistic lad who is psychically dull.  Strong shooting interest.

**Sep 15th**: Razor has taken a disliking to Chitto, accusing Chitto of spreading lies.  (This is from the [[RF] Rumor Has It...](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1554149030) mod.)

**Dec 2nd**: One of the visiting caravan's muffalo passed out from blood loss after we traded.  The caravan owners were spooked and refused to go near it.  It dumped out a large quantity of wood and food stuffs for us to grab.

## 5501

**Apr 5th**: Eyota (F32) / Waya (M28) become lovers.

**Jul 4th**: Cold snap starts.  We have about 1500 grains in storage, 2400 pemmican for the six colonists, and 1700 kibble for the eight dogs.  Low of -18C overnight.  I also have 235 packaged survival meals from the caravan incident.

**Jul 6th**: Eyota (F32) / Waya (M29) get engaged.  

**Jul 6th**: Captured Patient Tiger (F52) during a raid.  She has strong melee/crafting interest, but is lazy and neurotic.  She passed away from an infection due to the low skill of our doctors.

**Sep 5th**: Captured Aguirre (M44) from a drop pod.  A gourmand that likes mining.

**Sep 10th**: Eyota (F33) / Waya (M29) marriage.  

**Dec 8th**: Aguirre / Otoah get into a social fight.

## 5502

**Apr 12th**: Looking at trade goods for a caravan in the next few years.  Price per unit of mass is key since I don't have muffalo or other pack animals.

- $50/kg Cloth
- $220/kg Smokeleaf Joint
- $70/kg Pemmican
- $240/kg to $300/kg Cloth Tribalwear
- $125/kg Silver

Tribalwear is still a very strong contender for being an efficient caravan good.  It's available early on and trains up crafting.  The primary downside is storage space because it doesn't stack.

**Sep 2nd**: Started research of Complex Furniture (2250) with Otoah.  It's not his only job, so he'll get to it after cooking, mining and hunting.  I'm spoiled a bit by the Garden Lanterns from [Outdoor Lighting](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1545708330) which only have to be refilled every 20 days (torches are 10 days).

**Sep 5th**: Added Eyota to research duty, she's less busy.

**Sep 8th**: Waya comes down with the flu.

## 5503

**Apr 1st**: Finished Complex Furniture research, next is Comfortable Beds (750).

**Apr 12th**: Finished Comfortable Beds research, next is Stonecutting (2250).

**Jul 8th**: Eyota (F34) / Waya (M31) divorce.

**Jul 9th**: Finished Stonecutting research, next is Canning Table (3750) from VGP.

**Sep 7th**: Captured Skittish (M55), a wildman.  He is an optimistic night-owl with some interest in mining, animals, social and intellectual.

## 5504

**Apr 2nd**: Finished Canning Table research, next is Agriculture I (2500) from VGP for red lentils and snow beets.

**Apr 11th**: Finished Agriculture I research, next is Cocoa (5000).

**Jul 2nd**: A look at the relational dynamics going on in the colony.

- Eyota (F35) vs Tsoai (M19), equal dislike (-50) and they are rivals
- Eyota (F35) vs Waya (M32), Waya has a -50 against Eyota due to the divorce
- Eyota (F35) vs Aguirre (M47), about -25 on both sides due to lies / rebuffs
- Otoah (M29) vs Aguirre (M47), about -20 on both sides

I'm tempted to banish Eyota.

**Jul 3rd**: Sensory mechanites infect Razor (F57) and Otoah (M29).

**Dec 2nd**: Finished Cocoa research, next is Devilstrand (4000).

## 5505

**Apr 2nd**: Captured Sarai (F20) from a raid.  An industrious masochist with chemical interests.  Strong shoot/crafting affinities.  She has a 99% recruitment difficulty and a resistance over sixty.

**Jul 14th**: Muscle parasites affect Tsoai, Sarai (prisoner), Skittish.

**Sep 1st**: Finished Devilstrand research, next is Smithing (5250).

**Sep 12th**: Malaria strikes Otoah, Skittish, Tsoai.

## 5506

**Apr 11th**: Captured Hastiin (M45) during a raid.  At least, if he survives his wounds and the infection.

**Jul 7th**: Finished Smithing research, next is Drug Production (5000).

**Jul 9th**: Captured Crouching Sledgehammer (F60) from a raid.  

**Sep 8th**: Muscle parasites afflict Crouching Sledgehammer (prisoner), Razor and Otoah.

**Sep 11th**: Renamed Crouching Sledgehammer to Tadita.

**Dec 11th**: Malaria strikes Hastiin, Chitto, Sarai, Razor.

**Dec 15th**: Oh joyous occassion, the war merchant has brought two female and one male grizzly bear for purchase.

## 5507

**Jul 13th**: Captured Avro (F24) during a raid that ambushed Tsoai and Eyota.

**Sep 2nd**: Aguirre (M50) / Tadita (F61) become lovers.

**Sep 5th**: Finished Drug Production research, starting Farming (5625).

**Dec 14th**: Finished Farming research, starting Carpet Making (6000).

## 5508

**Apr 6th**: Hastiin (M47) gains chronic stomach disorder.
