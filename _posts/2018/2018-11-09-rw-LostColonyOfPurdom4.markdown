Restarting with a new colony now that Rimworld 1.0 is released and things should be stable for a long time.  I'm playing a heavily modded game, with semi-vanilla balance, but taking the rough edges off some things and adding some other things.  This will be the fourth attempt at the Lost Colony of Purdom (from the old Goon Show).

- Seed: "`red river belt`"
- Coverage: 100% (with average rain/temp)
- Storyteller: Phoebe, base builder (ramped up later)
- Scenario: Tribal start (modified to provide starting pemmican).

Faction names tend to differ across world generation (possibly based on some of the mods I have installed), but the world itself is identical in placement of rivers, mountains, biomes.  

## Key mod settings:

- Change Research Speed: 5.0x slower factor, with no tech advance allowed.
- Rainbeau's Fertile Fields: 40% chance for plowed to degrade to rich, 20% for rich to degrade to normal.  Automatic plowing and hard mode is turned on.
- Rainbeau's Rational Romance: 60% straight, 15% bisexual, 15% gay, 10% asexual.
- Supply and Demand: 250%

The big effect is the research speed and starting with few technologies, plus a tribal start making it all cost even more.  The passive cooler was 2000 and pemmican was 2500 to research.  A level 10 researcher is looking at 1/2 to 3/4 of a year to research something like passive cooler.  Unless I run multiple shifts per day and turn off all other jobs on the researcher.

## Colony location:

Seler Forest (18.98S, 125.14W). Temperature range of 5C-26C, avg 15.5C.  40/60 growing days.

## Starting tribe:

- Waya (M, 28): Plants/Crafting, son of Razor.
- Otoah (M, 25): Cooking, brother of Eyota.
- Eyota (F, 31): Medical, sister of Otoah.
- Chitto (M, 50): Shooting.  Also a night-owl.
