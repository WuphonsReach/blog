Back to playing a bit of [Mount & Blade: Warband](https://store.steampowered.com/app/48700/Mount__Blade_Warband/) which is a good RPG sandbox where you lead a party of heroes and soldiers to do whatever you want.  Carve out a kingdom? Swear fealty to a king and help them take over the lands?  Be a mercenary for hire?  Do your own thing and become hated?

A key mod that I recommend is [Diplomacy](https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,324014.0.html) which has been updated as recently as Dec 2018.

# Robert I

- Male
- Veteran Warrior
- Street Urchin
- Smith
- The Loss of a Loved One

Immediately after starting, you can export your character from the 'C' screen, edit the file and then import it back in.  Because I hate the grind, I also start with 500k in cash and some key skills bumped up.  The easiest way to do that is to edit the attribute/skills/weapons "_points" lines at the top of the file.  Give yourself six attribute, twelve skill and thirty-six weapon points.

It doesn't matter where you start, but you'll want to accomplish a few things in the first year:

- Find heroes and draft them into your party.  Note that of the sixteen, there are two sets of eight that get along fine but you can't mix-and-match between the two sets.  Or you can just turn off companion complaints in the Diplomacy options (on the Camp screen when you are roaming between locations).
- Do work for the guild masters so that they will grant you the ability to purchase a business in each main city.  This gives passive income over the long-term.  Note that with diplomacy options, different cities will have different profitable businesses, and you will need to investigate more instead of always picking a single industry.
- Build up a small set of infantry / calvary / ranged.  About 20-30 in total would be good.  Avoid mercenaries who are far more (twice as?) expensive per pay period.
- Look for special armor/weapons on the merchants.  This is where most of my nest egg ends up going.
- Sometimes villages get taken over by bandits, there will be a farmer in the tavern when this happens.  Or you can just go from village to village.
- Ask lords for tasks.
- Decide which faction you want to join.
- Keep party speed above 5.5 during the day when on flat terrain.  This can be done through higher pathfinding skill using one of the heroes, horses, or smaller party size.  Below that speed and you'll be caught by hostiles more often and won't be able to catch hostiles as quickly.

# Year 1257

## March

Started in Praven, didn't find much else besides a bit of armor/weapons.  The guild merchant wanted me to chase bandits, which I'm not prepared for.  Another merchant wants me to attack a bandit hideout, which I'm also not ready for.  That means I need to ride fast to Suno and leave the bandits / looters behind.

Got jumped by 12 Swadian deserters outside Vyincourd Castle.  They had crossbows, so I had to lead them in a merry chase around the hills until they ran out of ammo.  Then I turned and fought on more even turns.  My horse was grievously wounded by the end and I had to fight the last few on foot.  This will make for a good tale at the tavern.  Now to make my way to Uxkhal to search for more companions.

Still no luck.  Going to hire a few Swadian lads from a nearby village.  Then try Veluca in the Rhodok territory.  Due to deserters chasing me, I ended up at Dhirim instead.  I now have eight Swadian lads following me.  Untrained fodder, but they'll serve as a distraction.

Trying to get to Halmar and then back over to Veluca.

Recruited 2 Rhodok from Saren, an exposed village along the east flank of the Rhodok territory.

Found Artimenner (engineer) in Veluca.  Also Firentis (warrior).

Rescued four nords from a bandit party and hired them.

Found Jeremis and Borcha at Yalen.  Also helped a beggar in the streets, which gives me enough reputation with Yalen to purchase a business.  Looks like a tannery (8000 cost) will give profits of about 300/week.  Cleared out some bandits around Yalen, but Artimenner and Firentis are badly wounded and will need to rest up.

## April

Jelkala, seat of the Rhodoks.  Found Katrin.  My goal is about 10 Rhodok crossbows, 10 Nord melee, 10 Swadian knights, 10 Sarranid knights, and 10 Vaegir archers.  Maybe a bit less of each as I only want a party size of about fifty.

Picked up Rolf in Shariz and Matheld in Dhirim. Baheshtur joins in Tihr.  Klethi in Praven.

Setup a wool weavery in Praven for 6000 with estimated profits per week of 196 denars.

Picked up Deshavi in Suno.

Delivered 550 units of beef from Jekala to Rivacheg (it was worth a lot of money and XP).  Picked up Lezalit.  Boyar Meriga will not allow me to purchase a business in Rivacheg.

Did a favor for the guild-master in Khudan. Purchased a tannery.

Got a quest from Boyar Meriga to destroy the sea raider lair near Rivacheg.

Purchased oil press in Wercheg.

Purchased dye works in Rivacheg.

Hire Ymira in Curaw.  Purchase iron works in Curaw.

Purchase brewery in Tihr.  Purchase wool weavery in Sargoth.

Purchase tannery in Suno.

Pickup Nizar in Veluca.  Purchase oil press in Veluca.

First profitable week of over one thousand denars.

## May

Picked up Alayen in Yalen.  Picked up Marnid in Jelkala.  Purchased tannery in Jelkala.

I have only 25k left out of the 500k, but I should be making about two thousand per week in profits from the businesses.  There's maybe half-a-dozen cities where I do not yet own businesses.

Purchase olive press in Tulga.  Last week, I had a 2k profit and have 15k left in the satchel.

Pickup Bunduk in Rivacheg.

Cities, by controlling faction:
- (done) Nords: Sargoth, Tihr, Wercheg
- (missing 1) Vaegir: Curaw, Khudan, Rivacheg, Reyvadin (no)
- (missing a few) Khergit: Narra, Halmar, Ichamur, Tulga (yes)
- (missing a few) Sarranid: Bariyye, Almerrad, Durquba, Shariz
- (done) Rhodok: Jelkala, Veluca, Yalen
- (missing 2) Swadian: Dhirim (no), Uxkhal (no), Suno, Praven

That leaves me with about ten cities where I do not own businesses yet.  Mostly on the Sarranid and Khergit territories.

Purchased a tannery in Reyvadin for 8000, leaving me with about 15k denars.

Noticed that Halmar has been taken from the Khergit by the Sarranid.

Narra is controlled by Belir Noyan and I need his permission to purchase a business here.

Purchased olive press in Ichamur.

## June

Purchased brewery in Dhirim.

Purchased wine press in Halmar.

Down to about six cities where I don't have businesses: Narra (Belir Noyan), Uxkhal, Bariyye, Almerrad, Durquba, Shariz.

Purchased wine press in Shariz.

End of June.  Have a troop strength of 64 and a speed of 6.4-6.5 on open ground.  Renown is 150, which means I'll probably start getting liege offers soon.

Purchase tannery in Uxkhal.

Down to four cities where I don't have businesses: Narra (Belir Noyan), Bariyye, Almerrad, Durquba.

## July

Time to make a decision (and a save point) on day 100.  I'm going to join Rhodoks under King Graveth.  I've been granted a small village called Pagundur near Veluca.  It's not the worst location in the world to have (Saren is worse), but it is near the front lines with Swadia.

Count Reland is marshaling forces near Culmarr Castle.  I have chosen the black lark (white bird on black background) for my banner.

Swadia has taken Etrosq Castle (neighbor of Culmarr Castle) and there are 500-600 Swadian troops in the field.  Time to run.

Count Reland has been sacked, Count Laruqen (sword on black) is the new marshal.  Count Talbar is the only lord besides the king that is fielding 100+ troops.  Most of the Rhodok lords field 40-50 troops.

Started building a watch tower at Pagundur.  It takes 50% longer for enemies to pillage it, which isn't a huge help.

Yalen is under siege again, not sure where our marshal has wandered off to.  Ah, here he comes with the rest.  I'm going to pick-off a straggler Swadian troop of about fifty.  I'm down to only fourteen calvary (I need twenty-five).

This war drags on and on.  We took a castle on the far side of Swadian territory, only to lose it again.  Swadia keeps threatening Yalen, but we keep breaking the siege.  Swadia has lost Dhirim to the Nords, but I don't know if they'll keep it.

New marshal, Count Reichsin.  There's a feast planned at Weyyah Castle (near Shariz and the Sarranid).  

## August

New marshal, Count Matheas.  Followed shortly by peace with Swadia.  No real gains, no major losses.  Well, so far Swadia has lost Dhirim to the Nords.  But that doesn't help the Rhodok cause much.

Peace gives me a chance to visit villages and look for easy tasks like cattle or grain quests.  Or stumbling across a village that has been taken over by bandits.  All are good for reputation with the villages (I suggest ignoring the "train the peasants" quest).  I also need to keep doing tasks for King Graveth to earn his favor so I can get awarded a castle or town.

King Graveth is planning a feast at Weyyah Castle.  It is well attended.  (Note that with small venues that can't hold all the attendees, you need to leave/return the meeting hall in order to rotate who is attendance.  The goal is to say hello to everyone there, then ask for tasks once you've done the rounds.)

Lords with ten or better reputation towards me:
- +15 Tribidan (2 villages), also +15 to the king
- +11 King Graveth (castle, town)

Time to go visit towns / villages and ask for rumors.  It will give you information on the nature of various lords so you can spot the troublemakers and snakes.

Sarranid have taken Halmar, Narra and Ichamur from the Khergit.  Dhirim is now owned by the Vaegir.

Purchased a wine press in Durquba.  That leaves me with just Narra (Belir Noyan), Bariyye, and Almerrad where I don't have businesses.  Since Narra has changed hands, it's worth a trip over there to see if I can buy a business.  Huzzah, the new owner is neutral to me and I was able to pickup a tannery.

Narra has only 71 troops, it's likely to change hands soon.  And a day after that visit, Khergit have sieged it.  Khergit fail to take it though, leaving them with only Tulga.  Khergit took Narra a few days later, but I'm unsure if they'll keep it.

Another feast is planned for the 25th at Weyyah Castle.

War breaks out with Swadia on the 29th.  Swadia is already fighting the Vaegir for Dhirim.  

First act of the war by Marshal Matheas is to take Uxkhal.  Good job.  Now to see if we can hold it.  Took Suno as well from Swadia and Dhirim is under siege by Vaegir.  But the Sarranid have declared war on us too.

Lost Weyyah Castle to the Sarranid, but gained Ryibelet Castle from Swadia.

My troops are battered and worn (only ten calvary left) after days of fighting.  But we've captured two Swadian lords, two Sarranid lords and the king of Swadia.  Pagundur paid the price and has been sacked.  I've made about 5000 denars from captured prisoners and another 2000 for one of the Sarranid lords.  I'm going to convince King Graveth to sue for peace with Swadia, even if it costs me 10,000 plus in future ransoms.  We need to turn and focus on the Sarranid.

## September

Good, peace with Swadia on the 11th.  The Nords have declared on Swadia and are sieging Dhirim, if they take it that would leave Swadia with only Praven.

Now for Sarranid Sultanate.

The Vaegir ended up with Dhirim, leaving Swadia with just one city (Praven).  Swadia made an attempt to get it back, but failed.

We have taken Weyyah Castle back, but King Graveth awarded it to Count Etrosq despite my desire.

Nords and Rhodok enter a defensive pact on the 23rd.

Loaning Rolf to Count Gerluchs for a week or two.  That will sweeten him up as I've made no headway with him otherwise.

We lost Weyyah Castle again.  I'm going to follow King Graveth around.

Running at about 80-85 troops with a daylight open ground speed of 6.1.  They cost me about 1800/week.

Peace with Sarranid, we never kept Weyyah Castle.

Count Nasugei has been banished by King Graveth and has fled to the Vaegirs.

## October

Feast in Jekala, hosted by King Graveth.

Going to construct a mill in Pagundur to increase prosperity.  Artimenner reduces the cost to 4200 with a build time of 45 days.

17th: A feast has been announced at Ibdeles Castle.

The Sarranid and Swadia kingdoms have formed a defensive pact.

Sarranid declares war on Swadia.  So much for that pact.  It lasted maybe a week, tops.  We'll probably go to war with either Swadia or Sarranid soon, so I need to empty the coffers at Pagundur.

We've gone to war against both the Vaegir and Sarranid.  The Vaegir are already at war with Nords and Swadia, and the Sarranid are still at war with Swadia.  Count Reland is the marshal for now.

## November

We've taken Weyyah Castle and I've asked King Graveth to grant it to me.  He seems amenable to the suggestion.  But he gave it to Count Reland.

Swadia has taken Dhirim back for a total of two towns including Praven.  Vaegir have already sieged it again, so I doubt Swadia will keep it.

Count Trimbau has been banished by King Graveth and has fled to the Sarranid Sultanate.

Sarranid have taken back Weyyah Castle, good for them.

Count Nelag defects from Rhodok to Swadia.

Swadia declares war on Rhodok.  And huzzah, I've stumbled across Count Nelag already.  Run, you coward!

Loaned Firentis to King Graveth for a week on the 11th.

Count Laruqen has been appointed the new marshal on the 12th.

Peace with Sarranid on the 12th, we did not take back Weyyah Castle.

Started building a messenger post in Pagundur for 3000 denars.  Figure if I'm stuck with this little village, I should invest in it.

Peace with Swadia on the 30th.  We failed to take Praven.  Still at war with Vaegirs.

## December 

Nords have taken Praven on the 13th, capturing the Swadian king and half a dozen counts.  Swadia is now left with just eight castles and zero towns.

# 1258

Start of a new year.  Running with about ninety troops now.  Sixteen companions, twenty to twenty-five heavy calvary (Sarranid or Swadian), ten to fifteen archers, about ten crossbows and a mix of other melee for the rest.  Weekly cost is about 2000 and profits of 1500-2500 from the village and my businesses.  Plus whatever I can get for capturing and ransoming bandits or enemy troops.  Holding at about 30k in funds, having spent a bit on upgrading the arms and armor of my companions.  I'm ready for a castle, but none has fallen my way.  I may need to wait until I'm the marshal or start petitioning everyone to support my claim to the next town or castle.

## January

The war with Sarranid drags on with not much other than some village pillaging going on by both sides and Weyyah Castle being fought over like a bone between two hungry dogs.  Rhodok have formed a non-aggression pact with Swadia, which plays havoc with my goal of taking a Swadian castle soon.

The Sarranid war peters out with no result.

## February

Loaned Lezalit to King Graveth for a week.

Feast at Jelkala.

Possible bride choices (and fathers):
- Lady Calantina (Reland)
- Lady Aliena (Matheas)
- Lady Reada (Gutlans)
- Lady Geneiava (Talbar)

Gutlans only has a +7 relation with King Graveth and Tribidan has a -11 relation with the King.  Matheas has +43 so is more stable.  Marrying into Matheas line would be useful, but not Tribidan.  Other friendly lords are Laruqen, Reichsin, Fudreim, and Reland.  I have around +15 with each of them and they're all positive relations with the king.  Reland has a high trust value with the king (about 60).

I have 370 renown, Matheas 610, Gutlans 663, Reland 866.  It's possible that I don't have enough renown for Reland, but do for Matheas and Gutlans.

Mmm, there's also Etrosq, Talbar and Kurnias.  None of them are above +15 with me, but are all still in King Graveth's good graces.  Talbar is the only one with a daughter (Lady Geneiava), bringing me up to four possibles.  Talbar has 660 renown.

Back to the feast.  Gutlans recommends his daughter to me.  But I talked to Lady Aliena and she was receptive to my compliments at the feast.  So I will start there in an attempt to better my position within the realm.

Huzzah (er...), my village has been infested with bandits.  It's good at the meta-level because it will give me a +8 with the village for defeating them.

Talking with the wandering bard in the tavern:

- Lady Aliena likes to hunt and ride.  Count Stamar has given up.
- Lady Calantina likes to hunt and ride and is betrothed to Count Marmun.
- Lady Reada is romantic and unpredictable.  Count Rimusk was pursuing, but has given up.
- Lady Geneiava has the highest moral standards.  

I don't know the right poem for Lady Aliena, but I'm already at +21.  I need to go talk to Matheas.

War with Sarranid and Raichs is the marshal. Now would be a good time to get Weyyah Castle.

Huzzah, the king has granted me Weyyah Castle.  Now to defend it.  First step is to drop off all the troops and then run to get more recruits.  I now have 220 troops stationed in the castle of various training levels.  I'm going off to recruit and train more.  I need archers, but running over to Nord/Vaegir territory will take too long.

Ah good, the marshal has sieged Halmar.  That will take some heat off of my castle, I think.  It will give me time to run over to Nord/Vaegir territory after all.  And pick up some more Swadians on the way back.

Saw the Swadian king in the field, with only a troop of 70.  They've fallen on hard times.

Troop level at Weyyah Castle is 292, with wages of 1749 per week.  That's reasonable and will rise over time to about 2500 per week.  Weyyah Castle only has income of 980 and Pagundur earns 350-750 per week, plus the 1500-3500 from my businesses.  I'll need to step up my bandit hideout questing and capturing of bandits for spare money.  I'll be running around with a about 100 troops that costs about 3000/wk (35-40 heavy cav, 15 archers, 15 crossbows, 20-30 infantry).

Our army has taken Halmar and is laying siege to Narra.

## March

Narra is taken by us, but is under siege again.  I have 380 troops in Weyyah Castle now and about 100 in my personal warband.

Convinced King Graveth to go to where the Sultan of the Sarranid was pillaging and together we captured him.  That brings me up to four emirs and one sultan under lock and key in Weyyah Castle.

Mid-March, we have imprisoned nine of the Sarranid lords, including the sultan.  Only twelve lords roam free at the moment and I'm hoping to capture more of them.  They are at war with both us and the Khergit.

Had to duel Count Rafard for Lady Aliena.  So far, Count Matheas will not give us permission to wed.

Selling off my Sarranid prisoners.  Each trip nets me about 4000 denars.  Probably 12,000 for this war, if I can get rid of them before it ends.  Also have gotten a few lords ransomed at 2000-3000 each and the sultan was worth 10,000.  Plus shaking down a few merchant caravans for 900 denars at a time.

Finally got Matheas' permission at the feast of Culmarr Castle.  He put up 9000 denar and I put up 12,000 denar for her dowry.

## April

Marriage.  True love (of titles, money and power).

Vaegirs declare war on us.  Maybe we can take away Dhirim from them.
