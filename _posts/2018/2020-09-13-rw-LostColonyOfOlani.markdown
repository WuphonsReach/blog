Faction names tend to differ across world generation (possibly based on some of the mods I have installed), but the world itself is identical in placement of rivers, mountains, biomes.

Initial tribe members:

- Roo (M, 45): kind/tough, jack-of-all-trades
- Moon (F, 19): fast-learner/night-owl, jill-of-all-trades
- Lion (M, 32): undergrounder/kind, mining
- Nessy (F, 36): too-smart/tough/nimble, shooting/plants (Lion's sister)
- Canto (F, 38): undergrounder/optimist, jill-of-all-trades

5500 Sep 15th: Nessy/Roo break-up.

5500 Dec 2nd: Acomisa (M, 45) joins.  Pacifist (will not fight).

5501 Jul 1st: Capture Huntsman (M, 29), a wild-man.

5501 Sep 1st: Roo/Moon marriage.  Not sure it will last, because Moon is a night-owl.

5504 Dec 3rd: A megasloth (M, 11) self-tamed.  I now have Huntsman (M, 32) running around the outskirts of the colony, taming everything that he can.  Huntsman needs to gain enough skill to train the megasloth.  Otherwise, Sam Sloth will slowly revert to the wild.

5504 Dec 4th: Nessy/Acomisa marriage.

5504 Dec 15th: Lion's grandmother crashed near the colony on a transport pod.  He's on his way to rescue her.  Also, Cambi (F, 38) wanders in and joins.  Barra and Wazza have announced their engagement.

5505 Apr 11th: Abantra (F, 54, sister of Tau) crashes nearby.  Since she's hostile, we'll imprison and recruit her.

5505 Apr 14th: Larisa/Huntsman break-up.

5505 Jul 6th: Barra/Wazza marriage.

5505 Jul 11th: Xadaxe (M, 60) has the flu.

5506 Apr 4th: Rescued Cleo (F, 33) from a transport pod crash.  Not the brightest gal, so will end up as a cleaner.

5506 Apr 10th: Bringa/Ape are now lovers.

5506 Apr 13th: Captured Toxcurno (M, 60) and Curcri (F, 39) from a raid.

5506 Jul 9th: Toxic fallout has started to settle over the colony.  Those with bedrooms away from the main compound will have to live in barracks (crossing open ground with no roof will kill them eventually).  I have six sun lamps for indoor fields for food (two corn, one potato, one lentil, two for coffe/tea/fruit).  Plus all the canned veggies and canned meat that I stockpiled during the previous years.  The muffalo herd (six females) can also be slaughtered if needed.

5506 Jul 14th: Twenty-three colonists, six muffalo, two megasloths.  Inventory: 6100 silage, 4300 hay, 13700 kibble.  205 simple meals, 196 fine meals, 5700 canned meat, 1208 canned veggies.  The cans have 0.05 nutrition/can and colonists need 2.0/day when cooked.  Rough guess, 46 meals/day or about 8 days of meals on the shelf.  Plus about 170 days from the canned meat and veggies.  So I should be fine for about three years.

5506 Sep 1st: 6th Mayoral Election -- Tau / Moon / Canto -- Moon wins with nine votes.

5506 Sep 4th: After only 11 days, the toxic fallout is abating.  And we have a baby megasloth (named Allie).

5506 Sep 6th: A wanderer, Guago (F, 47) joins.  Another pacifist.

5506 Sep 10th: Huntsman/Mindy break-up.  Ape/Bringa get engaged.

5506 Sep 12th: Offered refuge to Carlos (M, 15).  Captured Mark (M, 51) from the pursuit force.  Mark has a destroyed lung.

5506 Dec 7th: Oh joyous day, the traders brought me three timber wolves (1F, 2M) and a female grizzly bear.

5507 Apr 4th: Bringa/Ape marriage.

5507 Apr 5th: Cambi/Huntsman are now lovers.

5507 Apr 11th: A wanderer, Gorilla (M, 44) joins.  Sally Sloth is pregnant again.  The sloths can end up eating us out of house and home, so I'll want to hold their numbers at six or so (which is like eighteen colonists worth of food per day).

5507 Apr 15th: Captured Locust (F, 49) during a raid.

5507 Jul 10th: Huntsman/Cambi break-up.

5507 Jul 12th: Xadaxe/Larisa break-up.

5507 Dec 10th: Offered refuge to Sam (F, 34).  

5508 Apr 3rd: Nessy/Acromisa divorce (about 5 years of marriage).

5508 Apr 4th: Acomisa/Moon are now lovers.

5508 Jul 4th: Thirteen colonists come down with Muscle Parasites.

5508 Jul 8th: Toxcurno turns 63 and now has hearing loss (-50%).
