Faction names tend to differ across world generation (possibly based on some of the mods I have installed), but the world itself is identical in placement of rivers, mountains, biomes.

Initial tribe members:

- Moon (F, 19): fast-learner/night-owl, Jill-of-all-trades
- Lion (M, 32): undergrounder/kind, mining
- Nessy (F, 36): too-smart/tough/nimble, shooting/plants (Lion's sister)
