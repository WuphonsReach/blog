Freya I

- Female
- Thief
- Street Urchin
- Game Poacher
- Lust for Money and Power

# Lusty Lords

Lords who profess their ardent admiration when they meet me:

- Ghulassen
- Reichsin
- Delinard

# Year 1257

## March to July

Running around looking for companions, armor, horses, and weapons.  Introducing myself to the various lords.

## August

I now have almost 200 renown and businesses in all the towns, so it's a good time to become a mercenary for one of the factions.  As a female, I won't be bothered by kings wanting me to join their faction until 700 renown, but it's customary to become a mercenary at this point.

I will start by signing up with the Sarranid.

## October

Left the service of Sarranid and joined Vaegirs.

## November

Switching to Swadia as a mercenary, they're struggling.  By mid-December I've taken back four or five castles and we've held them against the Vaegirs.

# Year 1258

## January

Nords are on the back foot, with only 10-12 centers (two towns, two castles) left.  Swadia has recovered enough that I'm going to switch sides when my contract runs out.  I have about 450k denars in my pocket, not quite enough to go looking for a claimant.  I want about 1500 renown and 1 million denars before I go hunting a claimant.

## March

Joined Swadia again as they are the weakest faction.
