# Lusty Lords

Lords who profess their ardent admiration when they meet me:

- Harish

- Matheas
- Tribidan

- Falsevor
- Surdun
- Klargus
- Dundush
- Rudin
- Alagur
- Montewar
- Logarson
- Despin

Some of these are married!

# Year 1257

## March to August

Running around looking for companions, armor, horses, and weapons.  Introducing myself to the various lords, before I get into any battles with them to see which ones profess that they are smitten with me.  Buying businesses in all twenty-two towns.

## September

Joining up as a mercenary for Swadia.  I have only 77 renown, 16 honor and 25k in funds.  My troops consist of sixteen companions and fifty-five mercenaries, including sixteen sword sisters.

So begins the long road to 1000 renown before I join a faction.

## November

I have about 150k in the purse and 500 renown.  Swadia is currently at war with both Nords and Vaegir.  I am not going to renew my contract at the start of December.

## December

Joined Vaegirs as a mercenary on the 4th.

# Year 1258

## January

Purse now contains 280k and renown is up to 600.

Working for the Rhodoks as of the 8th of January.

I'll be switching back to Swadia again in February as they are struggling.

## February

Up to about 750 renown and 400k in the purse.

## April

Up to about 800 renown and 600k in the purse.  Nothing much happened during March and I'm still working for Swadia.

My overall strategy is to push the Nords back to just Tihr, then join them and help them retake territory so that I can demand towns.

Not sure what town or castle I will take for an eventual capital.  Dhirim, Uxkhal and Suno all have small courts.  Halmar is no better.

## May 

Up to 900 renown and 750k in the purse.  I also have 39 right to rule.

Knudarr Castle might be a good primary residence for my court.  It has the larger interior.

## June

Leave Swadia.  About 1017 renown, 186 honor, 48 right to rule, and 900k in the purse.  Rhodoks are struggling with just two towns and a castle.  Kings won't take me as a vassal, so I'm going to go seek out a claimant to the throne.  Probably the Nord claimant.

Nope, found Lord Kastor of Veluca first.  Time to go take some Rhodok territory.

Uxkhal is first and I've requested it for my own.  The downside is that it comes with three villages that I can't give up until we win.  That causes tax inefficiency because I have too many fiefs.

One early task is to fill it with recruits, and also fill the chest with stacks of food (a focus on anything except grain/bread).

Khergit Khanate have declared war on us.  Rhodoks only have Jelkala left.

## July

I shall be known as "the black tulip".

Hunting down stray Rhodok lords.  They have no walled holdings.

Swadia declares war on us.  This will be mostly a defensive war on our part.

Rhodoks defeated, we are now the Rhodoks.

## August

Veluca is now mine.

## September

Weyyah Castle is mine.

Took Suno, requested it from the king.  And was granted it.  I keep hoping he'll deny me a fief so I can rebel.

## October

The kingdom of Black Tulip has been founded.  Artimenner is the minister for now.  I'm starting with Veluca as my capitol.  I own Suno, Uxkhal and Weyyah Castle.

I've appointed Firentis to a lordship, holding Vyincourd Castle as his first fief.  

Stats:  600k in the treasury, 500k in the purse, 1 lord, 48 right-to-rule (RtR), 277 honor and 1440 renown.

Persuaded Tellrog to join Black Tulip by promising that I will unite all of Calradia.  He is martial, so I shall make him my marshal.

Took Ergellon Castle on the 20th.

Sarranid declare war on the 21st.  

Took Jelkala on the 28th from Rhodoks.  That leaves them with just Teramma Castle up in Sarranid territory.  Gave Jelkala to Firentis, which makes Fraichin unhappy.

## November

Swadia declares war on the 3rd.  Large army of Sarranid seen near Weyyah Castle.

Ghulassen and Quryas have been banished by their kings and have joined Black Tulip.  I'm too busy at the moment hunting down distant Rhodok cousins to meet with them.
