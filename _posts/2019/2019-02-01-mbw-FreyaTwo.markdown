# Year 1257

## March to August

Running around looking for companions, armor, horses, and weapons.  Introducing myself to the various lords, before I get into any battles with them to see which ones profess that they are smitten with me.  Buying businesses in all twenty-two towns.

## September

Joining up as a mercenary for Swadia.  I have only 77 renown, 16 honor and 25k in funds.  My troops consist of sixteen companions and fifty-five mercenaries, including sixteen sword sisters.

So begins the long road to 1000 renown before I join a faction.

## November

I have about 150k in the purse and 500 renown.  Swadia is currently at war with both Nords and Vaegir.  I am not going to renew my contract at the start of December.

## December

Joined Vaegirs as a mercenary on the 4th.

# Year 1258

## January

Purse now contains 280k and renown is up to 600.

Working for the Rhodoks as of the 8th of January.

I'll be switching back to Swadia again in February as they are struggling.

## February

Up to about 750 renown and 400k in the purse.
