<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962">HugsLib</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p><color=orange><b>Important: </b> This mod should be loaded right after Core to work properly.</color><br />
HugsLib is a library that provides shared functionality to other mods.<br />
Version: 6.1.1</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544705976">ModCheck</a> by Nightinggale</h5>

<p>Adds more patching operations for modders and makes RimWorld start up faster due to faster patching.<br />
For players:<br />
Load this before Core<br />
If all mods keep ModCheck up to date, then this mod is not even needed. However if mods use multiple versions (like just after ModCheck has been updated), then loading the newest first becomes important, hence this mod and the need to load first.<br />
For modders:<br />
Follow the link for a guide on how to make your mod use the included features.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761315214">Map Reroll</a> by UnlimitedHugs</h5>

<p>Version: 2.4.0<br />
<size=20>Description</size><br />
Allows to randomize your starting maps and geyser locations until you find something you like.<br />
Every reroll has a cost- in the form of unmined resources from your map.<br />
<size=20>How to use</size><br />
Start a new game, or settle a new map. In the top right corner of the screen you will find a button with red dice. Click that.<br />
Use "Reroll Map" to pick a new map from a list of previews, or "Reroll Geysers" to get random new geyser positions on the current map.<br />
Each page of previews and geyser reroll operation will cost you an amount of unmined resources from the map- both the cost and the amount of remaining resources are displayed in the window.<br />
The resource cost is optional, and can be disabled in the Options > Mod Settings menu.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1545126946">[1.0] Modlist</a> by apkd</h5>

<p>Exports the list of enabled mods (and the download links) to modlist.txt (modlist.html) in the RimWorld directory. Can be transparently added or removed without making anything explode. <br />
Now also generates mod lists in HTML format.<br />
You can use this mod to share the list of your active mods with your friends.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1438693028">Progress Renderer</a> by Lanilor</h5>

<p><size=20>Progress Renderer (scheduled map renderings)</size><br />
Automatically create scheduled renderings of the full map or only a chosen part of it. There are many options to configure the mod in the settings.<br />
You can choose an interval from once a quadrum to hourly. Rendered images will be saved in a chosen directory. For example you can use them to create an animated gif or video of your current run.<br />
Place special corner marker designators to limit the area of what should be rendered. You can limit this to your base and even just simply extend it later if you base grows larger than planned.<br />
Based on the idea of Map Renderer by WIT (https://github.com/AaronCRobinson/MapRenderer)<br />
(Everything coded from scratch to work scheduled and with B19/1.0, which has the nice side effect of now being more performant and flexible.)</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1556062106">Speed Tweaks</a> by Fumblesneeze</h5>

<p>I felt that pawns shouldn't take a whole day just to walk one hundred meters so I tweaked some numbers to make them faster and make playing on lower game speeds bearable.<br />
Tweaks speed settings globally and adds a new carry weight penalty mechanic:<br />
- Pawns generally walk faster<br />
- Pawns generally shoot faster<br />
- Doors generally open faster<br />
- Carrying stuff will slow pawns down<br />
Update 4:<br />
- 1.0 Release<br />
Update 3:<br />
- B18 Update<br />
Update 2:<br />
- Fix Flash to the Rescue! bug<br />
Update 1:<br />
- A17 update<br />
- Animals will have half of the carry penalty applied to them at all times<br />
All the settings are customizable in the game using the mod settings.<br />
Requires HugsLib to be installed and loaded previously.<br />
Made using Harmony.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1309994319">Smart Medicine</a> by Uuugggg</h5>

<p>Doctors will use medicine from their inventory. What a concept!<br />
Doctors can also use medicine from the patient's inventory, or anyone else on the map, even pack animals brought on a caravan.<br />
They can also keep their inventory stocked with medicine. The Gear Tab has Settings for each Colonist.<br />
An option to use cheaper medicine, if it will do just as well ( due to doctor skill, bionics, medical bed, etc. ) Note this doesn't affect surgery.<br />
An option to use minimal medicine for non-urgent wounds, or none at all.<br />
An option to tend patients in the field - if there are no beds available, or just always.<br />
Multiple doctors can reserve the same stack of medicine. The game actually supports multiple reservations, but the feature was just not used.<br />
Now technically, inventory medicine is dropped and immediately picked back up - but what can you do.<br />
Check Steam page for any updated info.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1447140290">OgreStack</a> by Ogre</h5>

<p>Mod for customizing stack sizes. As well as the ability to target specific items.<br />
Improvements for v1.0:<br />
- Stack changes now do NOT require a game reload, if a stack is modified <br />
below a set stack size the stack is split up into smaller stacks.<br />
Should still save your game after every stack size adjustment; because<br />
if you adjust stacks, dont save, then reload a game, you could lose items.<br />
- Custom in game menu lets you pick between different modes ( scalar / fixed )<br />
+ scalar : multiplies the base count by the number specified<br />
+ fixed : simply sets the stack size to the number<br />
- Removed HugsLib dep since the hugs settings is no longer used.<br />
- Attempted to make it more clear how to set individual overrides<br />
via the Overrides.xml file.<br />
Load Order:<br />
- It hopefully won't matter. The stack modification code attempts to run after<br />
initial processing is complete. But if you have problems. Try moving<br />
OgreStack to last place.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1539311991">[RF] Fishing [1.0]</a> by Rainbeau Flambe</h5>

<p>(Last update: 11/11/2018)<br />
This mod gives pawns the ability to catch and cook fish.<br />
It's possible to create "fishing spots" adjacent to water, where pawns can catch fish. It's also possible to build "shellfish traps" that might net you shellfish, shrimp, snails or small fish. And your pawns can now prepare sushi and various other seafood dishes.<br />
(Is it ironic that this mod was created by someone who finds fishing to be mind-numbingly dull, and who hates seafood in any form? I think it's a bit ironic.)</p>

<h1>- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)</h1>

<p>How Fishing Works:<br />
Fishing is a custom work type, which relies on the "Animals" skill. Pawns with higher skill will fish faster, and have a higher chance of successfully catching something. (Additionally, fishing serves as a joy activity for pawns with a passion for the Animals skill.) Fishing spots can become depleted if overfished, and so will occasionally need to be allowed to "recharge."<br />
Fish and eels can be caught at any fishing spot, though the type of fish available varies with the biome, and eels are more common in marshes than in water tiles. Squid can only be caught in ocean tiles.<br />
Shellfish traps will periodically catch shellfish or tiny fish automatically, without any pawn interaction. They will sometimes take a bit of damage in doing so, though, and will thus occasionally need to be repaired.</p>

<h1>Fish and shellfish can be cleaned (butchered) for meat, while squid and eels can be butchered for both meat and leather.</h1>

<p>Compatibility:<br />
If you try to remove "Fishing" from a game in progress, you will very likely make the map unplayable, at least if your pawns have actually caught any fish and/or made any seafood dishes.<br />
Apparently, this mod conflicts with "Thanks for All the Fish," which doesn't really surprise me, as the two mods do many of the same things, albeit in different ways. I may eventually see about trying to make them compatible, but frankly, I'm not sure I see why anyone would need to use two different fishing mods at the same time, anyway.</p>

<h1>"Fishing" shouldn't conflict with any other mods.</h1>

<p>Credits:<br />
Most of the fish graphics were provided to me by Steam user Draegon.<br />
The ability to fish from bridges draws both conceptually and specifically from Rikiki's "FishIndustry" mod, though what I've done here is less elaborate than, and over time has diverged rather significantly from, what's he's done in that mod.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1509102551">[KV] Faction Control - 1.0</a> by Rainbeau Flambe (original) &amp; Kiame Vivacity</h5>

<p>"Faction Control" provides you with a number of configuration options that you can use to tailor which and how many faction groups and faction bases show up on your map. Simply visit "Mod Settings" from the game's "Options" menu.<br />
You can define the total number of faction groups which should appear on your world map (anywhere from 0 to 30), as well as individually adjust the minimum number of groups from each faction which should be present, even removing some factions entirely if you prefer. So you could, for example, play on a planet without any tribal groups, or without any outlanders, or on a planet with no pirates, or perhaps on a planet on which the only faction groups are pirate bands.<br />
The mod also gives you the same level of control over individual factions added by mods (up to 42 total) that it provides for vanilla factions. So, for example, if you're playing with a mod that adds several related factions, only some of which you actually want to have present on your world, well, you'll be able to tailor the planet accordingly. (This also gives you the ability to pick and choose which modded factions you want to use in any particular game without having to disable or uninstall the mods that add them.)<br />
As you increase the total number of faction groups on your world, the number of groups which are hostile to you will scale upward, as well. So unlike most mods which increase faction counts, this one won't allow you to create a world with 30 faction groups of which only three are hostile.<br />
You can also adjust your world map's faction base density, so you can create planets on which each faction group has only a few bases, or heavily populated planets with settlements everywhere.<br />
The mod also gives you the option to organize bases geographically, with each faction group's bases in close proximity to each other, so that the planet looks like it's populated by actual nations, rather than just having bases scattered all over the map randomly.</p>

<h1>- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)</h1>

<p>Compatibility:</p>

<h1>Since "Faction Control" does nothing but alter initial world generation, adding it to or removing it from a game in progress will have no impact. It should be compatible with any other mods, though it should (and most likely will) override any other mods that alter faction generation.</h1>

<p>Credits:<br />
The mod utilizes Pardeike's "Harmony Patch Library." (No additional download is required, as the library is included with the mod.)<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1322196379">Safely Hidden Away</a> by Uuugggg</h5>

<p>Bases that are in remote locations don't get raided as often.<br />
Configurable delay time. Check out that graph.<br />
Check Steam page for any updated info.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=0">Combat Readiness Check</a> by MarvinKosh</h5>

<p>Alters the normal threat points calculation.<br />
Threat points are used by the storyteller to, for example, 'buy' raiders from a list to make up the next group that will raid your colony or ambush one of your caravans.<br />
You can use the in-game Mod Settings menu to adjust some of the settings for how points are generated. Select Combat Readiness Check, and edit the values. They will stay in effect as long as you're using the same saved game folder.<br />
A debug option is available in the mod settings menu. This will output the current armoury points and building points to the log. Colonist points are also logged, but only if you turn on Write Storyteller in development mode.<br />
Wealth from weapons and armour counts at market value. Armour is anything which offers better than 29% protection against bullets or arrows.<br />
Wealth from pre-industrial weapons counts at 25% of market value.<br />
Wealth from other items is not counted (vanilla: all items are counted at market value, converted into points by wealth curve)<br />
The combined weapons and armour wealth is converted into points by the Combat Readiness wealth curve.<br />
Wealth from buildings is counted at 25% of value and converted into points by the Combat Readiness wealth curve (vanilla: 50% of value, vanilla wealth curve).<br />
Animals which have release training count for 9% of their combat strength (vanilla: similar percentage, but all animals that could be trained, even if they aren't trained).<br />
Colonists by default count for 45 points (vanilla: starts at 40 points and increases to 110 depending on colony wealth)<br />
Colonists who have impairment to their combat abilities (consciousness, manipulation, sight) will count for less points.<br />
Colonists with limited movement capability or a limited combined combat ability will count for zero points. <br />
Colonists in cryptosleep will count for zero points.<br />
Colonists who can't fight at all will count for zero points.<br />
Colonists who are suffering from an infection or disease which needs bed rest will count for zero points if they haven't developed immunity. <br />
Colonists who have enhanced capabilities (from bionics, trauma savant, mechanites or drugs) can count slightly more.<br />
The current adaptation factor affects the final colonist points value (vanilla: adaptation multiplies everything just like difficulty).<br />
The combined points are then processed by the Combat Readiness points curve (vanilla: no points curve).<br />
After that the points are multiplied by the modifier for difficulty level (vanilla: same).<br />
There is a global maximum of 10000 points or 20000 for Merciless difficulty (vanilla: 20000).<br />
Includes 'Adaptation and Random Threat Point Multipliers Cap to One' which changes the adaptation and random raid factors so that they cap at 1, reducing the effect of those factors.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=847661538">Fertile Planet</a> by Makaru</h5>

<p>Increases map fertility (vegetation and trees) moderately, and increases vegetation graphical size. Inspired by Helpful Bot's 'Increased Forest Density - Base Version' (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751887749)'</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1552146295">Real Ruins</a> by telewre</h5>

<p><i>"Everyone is dead or gone. This story is over.<br />
Perhaps someone else will find a use for the ruins of this place."</i><br />
Have you ever wondered who is that person which will find a use for those ruins?<br />
With this mod it might be any other RimWord player, and you will find ruins of other players' bases as well.<br />
This mod periodically uploads your base to the server database, and when a new map is generated, this database provides pieces of those stored bases as templates for abandoned ruins.<br />
Probably you'll find just empty dirty shelter with badly damaged wooden bed and a pair of chairs. Probably you'll be lucky enough to find someone's silver vault before scavengers from the nearest settlement arrive.<br />
This mod can be added anytime, it won't break your saves and will take effect when you enter into a new map, either starting a new game or with a caravan.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725465444">More Trade Ships</a> by PinoChemicali</h5>

Minor research is required for making more comfy beds.<br />
Simple bed with lowest comfort requires only wood/metalic/stone materials.<br />
Bench just like simple bed, but can also be used for sitting. Does not need research.<br />
Comfy bed requires 15 steel, 35 wood and 45 Textiles (leather/fabric).<br />
Comfy double bed requires 25 steel, 65 wood and 65 Textiles.<br />
Comfy royal bed requires 25 steel, 75 wood and 95 Textiles.<br />
Medical beed reqires now additional 35 cloth.<br />
Tropical Beds require less amount of textiles.<br />
Now beds are providing offset to comfortable Min/Max temperature.<br />
Warmer beds decrease maximum comfortable temperature, just like in real life.<br />
Recolored bed frame, bedcloth takes color of type(medical/normal/prisoner) and of used textile.<br />
For version that only adds new beds, leaving vanilla ones : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1418009530<br />

<p>(Last update: 10/14/2018)<br />
This mod adds a new "tribal raider" faction. Like pirates, tribal raiders raid you just because they can, and cannot be appeased with silver or by releasing prisoners. Be forewarned, worlds which include tribal raider factions can be quite hostile to newcomers!<br />
It also adds a "tribal planet" configuration option. If this option (accessible from the game's "Options" menu) is selected, outlander and pirate factions will be disabled, so that worlds will generate with nothing but tribal and tribal raider settlements. (And also, of course, settlements for any factions added by other active mods.) Spacer and mechanoid factions won't be disabled, though, so you'll still have to deal with mechanoid raids in the later game, and might still come across "ancient danger" crypts.</p>

<h1>- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)</h1>

<p>Compatibility:</p>

<h1>You shouldn't see any compatibility issues with this mod. You can add it to a game in progress, but unless you're using Orion's "Faction Discovery" or a similar mod, you won't see tribal raiders added to the game. Trying to remove it from a game in progress which includes any tribal raider factions will, of course, make the game unplayable.</h1>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1539314168">[RF] Tribal Pawn Names [1.0]</a> by Rainbeau Flambe</h5>

<p>(Last update: 10/14/2018)<br />
This mod overhauls tribal pawn naming. Why? Well, the tribal names in the game have always felt a bit... "off" to me. It's probably nothing more than my own unfamiliarity with the cultures from which the names are drawn, but I always thought they seemed a bit more "Spanish" than tribal.<br />
The changes made by the mod are as follows:<br />
- Tribal pawn names are now Native American in style. (I drew the names from online "Native American baby names" lists, by the way, which I'm well aware mix and match names from many different nations, and also feature many inauthentic names. But while they have many flaws, they provided the sort of names I was looking for. No disrespect to actual Native Americans is intended.)<br />
- Tribal pawn nicknames can now include various adjectives, terrain features, weapons and the like. So you might run into a tribal pawn named Vengeful Weasel, for example, or Deadly Scythe.<br />
- Since tribal names don't follow a "personal name followed by family name" pattern, anyway, the game no longer forces tribal pawns to share last names if they're related.<br />
- Tribal factions and settlements will now have names consistent with the style of the individual pawns' names.<br />
- Pets in tribal factions will also now be given tribal-style names rather than colonist-style names.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1539311500">[RF] Fertile Fields [1.0]</a> by Rainbeau Flambe</h5>

<p>(Last update: 11/04/2018)<br />
"Fertile Fields" is a terraforming mod that lets you fertilize and plow your soil, create farmland on solid rock so you can grow crops in inhospitable environs or inside of mountains, and eventually even restructure the landscape. <br />
Create raw compost with food waste at a butcher's table, then put it in a compost bin or barrel so in time it can become fertilizer. Fertilizer can be used to convert any soil to rich soil. Further improve your farm's fertility by researching farming and plowing your soil. Or learn the fine art of terraforming, and redesign your environment to your heart's content.</p>

<h1>- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)</h1>

<p>New Research and Terrain Improvement Options:<br />
Without researching anything, "Fertile Fields" allows you to do basic terrain modification, essentially just digging up dirt from one spot and moving it to another. You can also create raw compost and turn it into fertilizer, which can be used to upgrade your soil, even turning regular soil into rich soil.<br />
Researching "Farming" opens up the ability to plow soil, which lets you further increase the fertility of rich soil. As well, it allows you to lay topsoil over smooth stone. Create a garden inside a mountain if you're so inclined. Topsoil can be further improved by fertilizing it, but can't be plowed.</p>

<h1>Finally, "Terraforming" represents an understanding of advanced irrigation and drainage techniques, and opens up a wide variety of terrain-altering options. It allows you to turn marsh, mud, sand or shallow water tiles into farmable soil, or to turn fertile land into sand or marsh. It lets you create shallow water tiles from marsh, so you can create decorative (or defensive) moats. It opens up the ability to dump dirt into deep water to create shallow water, or to remove dirt from shallow water to produce deep water. It also allows you to break solid rock into rough gravel, which can be further improved into regular soil, letting you create mountain farms that can actually be plowed for maximum fertility. Conversely, you can turn rough gravel back into rough stone.</h1>

<p>Using the Mod:<br />
Most of what's added by "Fertile Fields" can be found on the new "Terraform" and "Farming" tabs of the Architect menu.<br />
A few things, however, are less obvious.<br />
Fertilizer is made from compost in either a compost bin or a compost barrel. Compost can be created at a butcher's table from vegetable matter and meat. It can also be obtained by burning corpses.<br />
Dirt can be created by mixing sand, clay and fertilizer at a crafting spot. Conversely, piles of dirt can be separated at crafting spots into sand and clay. Clay can be "fired" at a smithy to create bricks.<br />
Initially, if you need dirt, sand, clay or crushed rocks, you'll need to obtain them by digging up terrain somewhere on the map or by purchasing them from traders. Once you've built a rock mill, though, stone chunks can be turned to crushed rocks, which can be further ground into sand and then into clay. Sand and clay, as already noted, can be used to create dirt.<br />
Sandbags, by the way, are now made from sand, cloth and steel instead of just from steel, and the mod also introduces "heavy sandbags," made from sand, leather and steel.</p>

<h1>For a more detailed overview of everything the mod has to offer, you can consult the "Getting Started with Fertile Fields" text file located in the mod's "About" folder.</h1>

<p>Compatibility:<br />
"Fertile Fields" is not, at this time, compatible with Lanilor's "Terra Core" mod. That mod makes extensive changes to map and terrain generation, and adds far more terrain types than even exist in the vanilla game. To properly handle transformations between all of those new terrains would be a very extensive undertaking.<br />
"Fertile Fields" should be compatible with most any other mods, though. If you run into specific issues, please let me know.<br />
New terrains added by a number of mods are automatically recognized by "Fertile Fields." Night soil from Dub's "Hygiene" mod can be terraformed with any conversion that works from marshy soil. (Note that that mod has its own compost and fertilizer system, which is not consistent with what's provided by this one. There may be odd overlaps or misbehaviors if they're used together.) Wasteland from the "Crashlanding" mod can be terraformed as sand. Reclaimed soil from CuproPanda's "Quarry" mod can be terraformed as if it was gravel. Hot and cold springs from "Nature's Pretty Sweet" can be transformed as if they were shallow water tiles, and that mod's various "wet" sand and soil terrains can be transformed using terraforming jobs that work on comparable vanilla sand and soil terrains. The various rocky soils to be found on "Biomes!" cavern maps can be terraformed with any conversion that works on rocky dirt. And decrystallized sand and soil from "Tiberium Rim" can be terraformed as vanilla sand and gravel, respectively. (Note, though, that the various tiberium terrains introduced by that mod cannot be altered by anything in "Fertile Fields." To get rid of tiberium, you'll still need to utilize the mechanisms actually provided by "Tiberium Rim.")<br />
"Fertile Fields" is compatible with "Seeds Please!" However, if you're using that mod, the soil degradation feature of this mod won't be functional, and you won't get plant scraps from cutting plants. I'll see about resolving those issues in the near future.<br />
If this mod is used together with either "Glass+Lights" or "Dub's Skylights," then creation of the glass from those mods will require the sand from this mod.<br />
You should be able to add "Fertile Fields" to an existing saved game without trouble, but removing the mod from a game in progress will, of course, likely cause problems or even make the game unplayable.</p>

<h1>Special note regarding "Vegetable Garden": I've tried to ensure that "Fertile Fields" and "Vegetable Garden" are compatible with each other. Most elements of the "Vegetable Garden Project" are unchanged. However, if you're using "VGP Garden Tools," you'll notice that its fertilizing and terraforming options are missing, as they duplicate existing "Fertile Fields" functionality, and that its various new planter boxes, sunlamps and hydroponics basins are located in this mod's "Farming" tab along with their vanilla counterparts. Finally, be aware that if you try to add "Fertile Fields" to a game in which you've already been using "VGP Garden Tools," you may encounter problems.</h1>

<p>(Last update: 11/15/2018)<br />
"Rational Romance" overhauls RimWorld's romance system, fixing some problems and adding some new options. Think of it as a "spiritual successor" to SeveralPuffins' popular but sadly abandoned a17 mod, "Romance Diversified."</p>

<h1>- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)</h1>

<p>What It Does:<br />
(1) Adds Orientations. All pawns will now have a trait indicating their sexual orientation, either asexual, bisexual, gay or straight. (Don't worry; the mod doesn't "waste" a trait slot on this, as orientation traits are assigned only <em>after</em> regular trait assignment is complete.)<br />
By default, pawns have a 50% chance to be bisexual, a 20% chance to be gay, a 20% chance to be straight, and a 10% chance to be asexual. I set the percentages this way because biological, sociological and historical evidence strongly suggest that, in the absence of cultural imperatives to the contrary, bisexuality is actually the "default" status for most humans. However, the percentages are all configurable in the mod's "options" menu, so you can set things up however you prefer for your own games. If you're radically heterosexist and don't want any gays in your colony, go right ahead and set the mod to make pawns 100% straight. On the other hand, if you want <em>all</em> your colonists to be queer, more power to you! And if you just want to play on a planet full of asexuals, where nobody worries about romantic entanglements at all, well, you can do that, too.<br />
(And yes, I'm aware that I'm using certain terms rather loosely. "Bisexual" isn't the only or even necessarily the best term to describe someone whose romantic interests are not governed by gender or gender presentation, but it's a convenient and widely familiar term that fits the mod's needs. Similarly, while I know that not all asexual individuals are aromantic, the game draws no distinction between romantic and sexual relationships, and so the use of the term "asexual," though not strictly accurate, is convenient. On a related note, sadly, there's really nothing I can do to correct the fact that the game forces pawns to conform to the idea of a gender binary.)<br />
(2) Adds New Traits. The mod adds two new traits, "Faithful" and "Philanderer," which influence how likely a pawn is to cheat.<br />
(3) Adds New Activities. The mod adds long walks as a date option for couples, allowing them to socialize and improve their relationships. It also adds casual hookups as a joy activity for single pawns.<br />
(4) Improves Romantic Behavior in General. Pawns will no longer make romance attempts if they've been recently rebuffed, and won't target pawns for such attempts who are currently in mental break or with whom they already have a romantic relationship. Pawns will neither initiate nor receive romance attempts if they have a high opinion of their current lover. And pawns who are gay or straight will be more likely to rebuff romance attempts by pawns of the "wrong" gender, will be more likely to breakup with partners of the "wrong" gender, and will never accept marriage proposals from pawns of the "wrong" gender. Finally, the impact of the Ugly trait on romantic attraction is lessened for pawns who have that trait themselves. <br />
(5) Makes Culture Matter. There is now a cultural component to pawns' romantic interactions, with female pawns from tribal and imperial backgrounds more forward (more likely to initiate romantic encounters or to propose marriage) than males from those cultures, and male pawns from medieval and urbworld backgrounds more forward than females from those cultures.<br />
(6) Adds Support for Polyamory. Polyamorous pawns prefer relationships involving multiple partners to simple monogamous relationships. You can decide in the mod's "options" menu how likely pawns are to be polyamorous. Like the orientation traits, Polyamorous is an "extra" trait assigned after normal trait assignment is complete, so allowing pawns to be polyamorous won't in any way limit their access to other traits. The default chance for polyamory is 0%, as the system isn't yet fully tested, and even if it all works as intended, it may still complicate colony management in unexpected ways. If you do want to include polyamorous pawns in your games, I strongly encourage you to also use Meltup's "Polyamory Beds" mod, which will allow you to more easily accommodate your pawns' desired sleeping arrangements.<br />
(7) Adjusts Romance-Related Mood Penalties. Penalties and/or stack limits for rebuffs and other romantic failures have been reduced. You should no longer see pawns hitting on someone a few times, getting rejected, and then going on a murder spree as a result.</p>

<h1>(8) Fixes Some Problems in the Game's Romance-Related Code. Female pawns will now be just as likely as male pawns to initiate romance attempts or to propose marriage, subject to the cultural variations mentioned above. Gay pawns will be no less likely than straight pawns to be parents. And male and female pawns will both now prefer partners near their own age but potentially accept either younger or older partners, unlike in vanilla, where men have a strong preference for younger women and women for older men.</h1>

<p>Compatibility:<br />
"Rational Romance" can safely be added to a game in progress. (Pawns without orientation traits will be assigned them as they enter into social interactions for which orientation is relevant.) The mod cannot, however, be removed from a game in progress.<br />
This mod is fully compatible with "EdB Prepare Carefully."</p>

<h1>This mod is NOT compatible with "Psychology." You may or may not actually notice any problems if you try to use them together, but the mods both alter some of the same vanilla code, and if they're both installed, neither will be operating entirely as intended. For similar reasons, "Rational Romance" isn't likely to be compatible with any other mods altering RimWorld's romance systems, either.</h1>

<p>Credits:<br />
The mod utilizes Pardeike's "Harmony Patch Library." (No additional download is required, as the library is included with the mod.)<br />
Obviously, "Rational Romance" owes a great deal to SeveralPuffins' "Romance Diversified." In particular, the code for the new social activities comes directly from that mod. Other mods from which I borrowed code bits and/or ideas include "Less Stupid Romance Attempt" by Dazz Aephiex (for improvements to romantic behavior), "Grim Reality" by SheiFoxy (for alterations to mood penalties), and "Everyone is Queer" by Suzi (for general problem fixes).</p>

<h1>Some of the code related to polyamory is borrowed from Linq/Word-Mule's "Psychology" mod.</h1>

<p>License:</p>

<h1>If you're a modpack maker and want to include "Rational Romance" in your pack, or if you're a modder and want to use it as the basis of a derivative mod, please feel free to do so. I ask only that you let me know about it.</h1>

<p>If you have any (helpful) suggestions for improvement, please let me know!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521">While You're Up [1.0]</a> by kevlou</h5>

<p>"So long Bob, I'm heading back home for some food!"<br />
"OK Jim.  Hey, while you're heading over there, mind hauling some of this wood we chopped?"<br />
"Can't do it Bob, I'm cooking now.  More important than hauling."<br />
"But Jim, you're literally walking from the forest back to where this wood needs to go.  Can't you just carry some of it while you're up?"</p>

<h2>"Sorry Bob, I don't know the meaning of 'while you're up.'"</h2>

<p>Before starting most jobs, your colonists will look for nearby objects that need to be hauled someplace near wherever they're already going.  If they can haul something useful without going out of their way, they'll do it, even if hauling is a low-priority task.<br />
RimWorld colonists sometimes do this in the base game; with this mod they'll find more opportunities to do so.<br />
Requires HugsLib.  Doesn't require a new save.<br />
Works fine with most mods, but if you have any that add new job types, those job types may not get the "haul first" treatment.<br />
Keep in mind:<br />
- Opportunistic hauling only happens at the start of a job.  If your colonist must make a long trip in the middle of a job, they'll just make the trip like they always have.<br />
- By the time a colonist has completed an opportunistic hauling job, someone else may have started doing the work they were going to do... which means it may no longer be important for them to be wherever they are.<br />
- After completing their hauling job, colonists will attempt to resume their previous work. If they can't for any reason, you'll get an error message in Developer Mode. As far as I can tell these are ignorable, but there's a mod setting you can use to turn it off.<br />
- If the game runs too slowly, While You're Up has an option in mod settings to search less aggressively, using less CPU.<br />
- There's also an option in there to make bleeding colonists not look for these jobs (so they won't search for something to haul on their way to the hospital, for instance).</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=0">Snow Clearance Sanity</a> by MarvinKosh</h5>

<p>This mod means that your colonists will avoid an endless loop of constantly clearing snow when it is currently snowing. It also reduces the priority of clearing snow so that cleaning dirt is taken care of first.<br />
New in this version, if you need to, you can still order colonists to prioritise clearing snow.<br />
[Version 1.0.1]</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542424432">Please Haul Perishables</a> by MarvinKosh</h5>

<p>Adds new WorkGivers for hauling, which prioritise hauling perishables or food over non-perishables. Items will be considered perishable if they would rot in less than a year or deteriorate to zero hitpoints in ten days or less.<br />
Rain and water, which both cause higher deterioration rates, will be taken into account.<br />
Perishable items will only be given priority for hauling if they are outside.<br />
A check is made to see if the perishable has a large enough stack size. Things which have a maximum stack size of 1 (weapons and apparel for example) pass automatically. Other perishables must have a high enough stack count for that kind of item. The exact threshold depends on the hauler's current carrying capacity and the ideal carrying capacity for their race, but it only goes as high as 40. The perishable can still pass the check if there are other perishables of the same type nearby, or if it would deteriorate to zero hitpoints in ten days or less.<br />
Food will also be hauled if it needs to go from low to high priority storage.<br />
A new general hauling routine prefers valuable items like silver or big stacks of items for hauling, regardless of whether they are perishable or not. It will look at a square grid and a plus-shaped grid of cells to see if a big stack of the same type of item could be made. The normal general hauling routine picks up any leftovers.<br />
New in this version, if Pick Up and Haul is active, the mod will use its hauling routine instead, but the order in which things will be hauled will still be decided by this mod.<br />
Also, to improve performance, the lists of things to be hauled will be cached in memory and only updated when a certain number of in-game ticks have passed.<br />
A debug mode exists and will give feedback when you right-click a haulable, so if it is not considered perishable or food or a big stack, that will show as a reason for not doing the job, in addition to still allowing you to manually prioritise hauling.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542424055">Clear The Stockpiles</a> by MarvinKosh</h5>

<p>Adds a new WorkGiver for hauling, which prioritises clearing stockpiles of blockages that may if there are extra products from doing a bill at a work table.<br />
The behaviour of this WorkGiver is as follows:<br />
If an item doesn't belong in a stockpile, first a check is made to see if there is a valid stockpile within a radius of 18 of the item. If so, the item will be taken there.<br />
If no valid stockpile was found or no stockpile with enough space was found, the item will be dumped in a small radius of its original position. This position will not be next to or in a doorway or on top of a trap.<br />
The clearing routine by default runs at a higher priority (85) than hauling corpses (corpses can block stockpiles, no reason not to haul those) but at a lower priority than burying and stripping corpses.<br />
In the mod settings, you can configure the radius in which to search for matching stockpiles, between 1 and 25.<br />
In this version, a bug was fixed, a little bit of optmisation was done, and a debug mode was added to the mod settings. The debug output can get a bit spammy in the output log, so only turn it on for troubleshooting.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1545708330">Outdoor Lighting</a> by Stormknight</h5>

<p>Introduces a number of options for outdoor lighting.<br />
Your colonists move slower and work slower when they are in the dark, but having a network of standing lamps around the gardens and outside of your base is a drain on power when they are busy working during the day.<br />
Sure, you could flag them all to be turned off and a colonist could do that every morning, switching them back on again every evening, or .... you could have [b]lamps that automatically turn themselves off during the day![/b]<br />
Clean and stackable, as it makes no changes to existing items in the game. All items are found on the furniture tab.<br />
Includes:<br />
- Garden Lanterns - including pumpkin lanterns!<br />
- Garden Lamps - auto power-off during the day, in a variety of colours.<br />
- Solar-powered Garden Lamps - auto power-off during the day, in a variety of colours.<br />
- Lamp Posts / Street Lamps - also auto power-off during the day, in a variety of colours.<br />
Garden Lanterns<br />
There are three garden lanterns available that can be built without any research needed. Functionally, they are the same as a torch, but hold twice as much "fuel" lasting for 40 days without needing to be re-fuelled.<br />
- Standard garden lantern - gives off a slightly yellow light.<br />
- Garden lantern (blue) - the same as the standard lantern, but with slightly different graphics and a blue tint to the light.<br />
- Pumpkin lantern - there are no pumpkins on the rim, so this is carved from wood and reinforced with a bit of steel.<br />
Outdoor Lamps<br />
A variant of the vanilla Standing Lamp..<br />
- Alternative graphics for the lamps.<br />
- Must research [i]Electricity[/i] before it is available to build.<br />
- The outdoor lamps automatically turn off at 07:00 to save power during the day. They automatically turn back on at 17:00.<br />
- Once [i]Colored Lighting[/i] has been researched, they can be built in a variety of colours, including: red, blue, green, purple, and orange.<br />
Outdoor Solar Lamp<br />
Identical to the Outdoor Lamp from this add-on, except:<br />
- Must research [i]Solar Panels[/i] before it is available to build.<br />
- No need to run power to these lamps - they power themselves by absorbing energy during the day! They can also be easily moved when needed.<br />
- Visually different - the small solar panel can be seen by the lamp, making it easy to see which lamps are which.<br />
Lamp Posts / Street Lamps<br />
Taller and more powerful than the standard lamp:<br />
- Larger pool of light, in a variety of colours (requires [i]Colored Lighting[/i] has been researched).<br />
- Provides limited cover in a gun fight.<br />
- Visually different to standards lamps - when placing, circle shows approximate area that will be lit.<br />
Floodlights!<br />
- 6x the power of a regular lamp, covering light in a radius of 15 squares.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1552461911">Expanded Incidents</a> by Linq</h5>

<p>This mod increases the variety of incidents your colony faces. The new incidents are designed to be balanced, generally long-term events that you can mitigate or eliminate with proper planning or response, so long as they have any significant impact on your colony.<br />
Expanded Incidents does not require a new save game. It's compatible with everything. It will use Psychology's systems if you have both installed.<br />
<b>New Incidents</b>  <br />
- Quarrel: Two pawns friendly towards each other have their relationship damaged by an argument until they make up.<br />
- Homesick: One of your pawns is feeling homesick. They may spread it to other pawns through conversation, until they've made your whole colony unhappy!<br />
- Cliques: Two pawns who dislike each other separate the colony into cliques of their friends. Members of each clique may come to blows.<br />
- Sabotage: Keep a close eye on your colonists if you notice things malfunctioning in your base. Someone has to be to blame. But who?<br />
- Thief: Colonists and pets may spot thieves attempting to sneak into your base and steal valuables, who won't leave without a fight!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1552452572">Death Rattle</a> by Linq</h5>

<p>This mod makes it so that people will no longer instantly die when their vital capacities reach zero. If one of your colonists has their liver destroyed by a charge lance, for instance, they will become severely ill and you will have a short window to get them a new liver before they die.<br />
The time scales in this mod are not entirely realistic, because Rimworld's time scale makes it effectively impossible for a colonist to receive life-saving care in a realistic amount of time. Colonists move too slowly, and days pass too quickly, so the numbers have been fudged to make it difficult, but possible, to save someone if you have a donor organ on hand.<br />
Be warned: Just because they survive, doesn't mean they won't suffer permanent brain injury as a result of their near-death experience.<br />
Don't ask me about compatibility. It should be compatible with everything. Just try it, and let me know if it doesn't work, so I can fix it.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1552455241">Less Arbitrary Surgery</a> by Linq</h5>

<p>This mod changes surgery success to be less arbitrary and random. It doesn't change your surgeon's chance of success, but it does change failures in the following ways:<br />
-If they don't succeed, they get a second chance to succeed with non-lethal injuries.<br />
-If they fail, they have a chance to only give non-lethal injuries based on their surgery skill (as they identify that the patient is dying and abort the surgery).<br />
-If they fail that, then the death on failed surgery chance is reduced by their chance to successfully complete the surgery.<br />
-If the surgery is not lethal, the difference between catastrophic and minor failure is based on the surgery success chance, instead of being a literal coin flip.<br />
-Only impaired pawns will ever have ridiculous surgery injuries.<br />
-Instead of doing 20 damage on a minor failure and 65 on a catastrophic failure, minor failures do 10-20 damage and catastrophic failures do 30-60. This makes it so that some surgeries (like on the head) are not disproportionately lethal even on minor failures.<br />
-Instead of doing between 50-100% of a part's remaining health in damage per surgery injury, failures do between 10-25% of a part's remaining health, so that an injury is far less likely to kill or sever a part on a patient unless its total damage exceeds the part's remaining health.<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1554149030">[RF] Rumor Has It.... [1.0]</a> by Rainbeau Flambe</h5>

<p>(Last update: 11/03/2018)<br />
Have you ever wondered why your pawns don't talk about each other? <br />
Did no one wonder about sending that shifty cannibal Alex to bury the dead? How come Ray likes the abrasive psychopath who beat up her friend, just because she's never been insulted directly? And why is no one ever apologetic about anything they've done?<br />
If you want more social complexity, or just enjoy gossip and intrigue in your stories, then look no further! "Rumor Has It" -- an update of SeveralPuffins' popular but sadly abandoned a17 mod, "Rumours and Deception" -- adds new social interactions, traits and thoughts that largely focus on people talking about people.</p>

<h1>- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)</h1>

<p>What It Adds:<br />
(1) New Interactions!<br />
- Chat About Other Pawns: Alice likes Bob. Bob hates Carol. Bob can now tell Alice this!<br />
- Quarrel: Even friendly pawns can sometimes have their relationship damaged by an argument....<br />
- Spread Rumor: Pawns will tell nasty, unsubstantiated tales to each other, particularly about pawns that neither of them like.<br />
- Share Secret: A pawn can trust another enough to reveal something deep and personal, bringing them closer together.<br />
- Reveal Secret: There's no guarantee that all trust is well placed! Pawns who have been told a secret can go and gossip about it to their friends!<br />
- Apologize: Pawns can try to make up with others that they've insulted or hurt.<br />
- Make Peace: Pawns may try and apologize on behalf of a third party.<br />
- Culture Clash: Not all insults are intended! One pawn may insult another due to having a poor understanding of the other's cultural background. (Would you really expect a tribal pawn, for example, to understand glitterworld cultures?)<br />
(2) New Traits!<br />
- Compulsive Liar: Pawns with this trait just can't help themselves. Every conversation is an opportunity to make up some new, snide story about someone else.<br />
- Gossip: Gossips talk about other people all the time. This extends to secrets, with which they simply can't be trusted.<br />
- Gushing: Some pawns just cannot judge who to trust with their darkest secrets, exposing themselves to potential embarrassment.<br />
- Manipulative: Pawns with this trait will use any social trick they know to make other people see things their way. They are great negotiators, but can be divisive and isolating within a colony.<br />
- Peacemaker: Some pawns just can't stand to see their friends fighting. They will try to resolve other people's differences, and will get a mood boost if successful.<br />
- Trustworthy: Trustworthy pawns keep secrets. They rarely spread rumors, and if they do, they feel terrible about it.<br />
(3) New Events!<br />
- Defection: Socially isolated pawns will suffer mood penalties and very regular mental breaks. If they remain friendless, they may, occasionally, walk off the map and join an ally.<br />
- Splinter: In the unlikely event that a clique of friends forms within the colony that is largely hostile to its other members, they may choose to leave together and form a new map faction. They will take some of the colony's belongings with them as they go. <br />
- Brawl:  Even if they don't leave, hostile cliques will start fights. Unless you patch up your fractured colony, mass brawls will break out. <br />
NOTE: All of these events can be switched off in the mod's "Options" menu, but not entirely without consequence. Divided colonies, after all, are unhappy colonies.<br />
(4) Negative Traits are Ameliorated for Those Who Share Them!</p>

<h1>The negative impact of the Annoying Voice, Creepy Breathing, Disfigured, and Ugly traits is reduced for pawns who have any of those traits themselves. (This was originally a feature in SeveralPuffins' "Romance Diversified" mod, but I think it fits better here, in a mod that primarily focuses on what pawns think of each other.)</h1>

<p>Compatibility:<br />
"Rumor Has It" can safely be added to a game in progress. Removing it from a game in progress, however, could create problems.</p>

<h1>This mod should be compatible with "Psychology," though you might notice that some traits or incidents overlap conceptually.</h1>

<p>Credits:<br />
Obviously, "Rumor Has It" owes a great deal to SeveralPuffins' "Rumours and Deception," inasmuch as it's pretty much just a direct update of that mod.</p>

<h1>The "Quarrel" incident is taken from Linq/Word-Mule's "Expanded Incidents" mod.</h1>

<p>License:</p>

<h1>If you're a modpack maker and want to include "Rumor Has It" in your pack, or if you're a modder and want to use it as the basis of a derivative mod, please feel free to do so. I ask only that you let me know about it, and that you credit both me and SeveralPuffins.</h1>

The origin of this technology is unclear, as the superior draft-principle might have been invented or (re-)discovered by several people or cultures at different times and places in human history. Due to the elaborate proportions that are needed inside a rocketstove, more than only basic metal- and stoneworking knowledge is required to build it. Well, actually not at all, you might only need some crafty aptitude and common sense. But... balancing reasons!</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1545872070">[RF] Etched Stone Walls [1.0]</a> by Rainbeau Flambe</h5>

<p>(Last update: 11/04/2018)<br />
Since beta 19, vanilla RimWorld has allowed you to smooth natural stone walls. This allows you to have real walls in the rooms in your mountain hideaway, without needing to mine out rock and then immediately replace it with a wall built from scratch. But smoothed stone walls are, as you'd expect, smooth. They don't have the graphic patterning that constructed (block) walls have. <br />
Some players prefer to have all their walls look exactly the same. And that's where this mod comes in. You can have your crafty pawns "etch" the smoothed stone walls, to give them a pattern that matches the brick pattern in constructed walls. Alternatively, you can have a pawn with artistic skill do decorative etching, in which case at least some of your wall tiles, in addition to a brick pattern, will end up randomly decorated with pictures.</p>

<h1>- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf)</h1>

<p>Compatibility:<br />
"Etched Stone Walls" adds a new capability, but doesn't change any existing things, so it should be compatible with pretty much any other mod. You should be able to add it to an existing saved game without trouble. Removing it from a game in progress, however, will make the game unplayable if you have any etched or decorated walls on the map.</p>

<h1>"Etched Stone Walls" should be fully compatible with stone types added by other mods, at least as long as those mods follow vanilla's convention for walls' defNames, meaning that you'll be able to smooth walls of non-vanilla stone types as easily as you can those of vanilla stone types.</h1>

<p>Credits:<br />
Most of the images used for wall art came from the flaticon.com Web site.</p>

<h1>The mod utilizes Pardeike's "Harmony Patch Library." (No additional download is required, as the library is included with the mod.)</h1>

<p>License:</p>

<h1>If you're a modpack maker and want to include "Etched Stone Walls" in your pack, or if you're a modder and want to use it as the basis of a derivative mod, please feel free to do so. I ask only that you let me know about it.</h1>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1539313434">[RF] Rainbeau Flambe - Storyteller [1.0]</a> by Rainbeau Flambe</h5>

<p>(Last update: 10/14/2018)<br />
This mod adds a new storyteller, Rainbeau Flambe.<br />
Rain shares Randy's love of the unpredictable, but tempers that love with a bit of Cassandra's storytelling flair. Still, he'll send big threats nearly as often as small ones. He seems to have a bit of a sadistic streak, and in any event, he has to keep his cat, Sabre, amused. He also likes to have a slightly larger cast of characters to work with than Cassandra does, and so will subtly encourage you to have more colonists.<br />
The mod also slightly increases the base chance of orbital traders arriving, though the actual frequency of their arrival is not altered.<br />
Some player testimonials:<br />
"[Rainbeau is] real good on providing a constant supply of traders and challenges."<br />
"Yep. Three events after one minute. And after that I had some time for my colonist. I like that challenge."<br />
"I have to say I'm really satisfied with this storyteller.... Rain (on some challenge and later on rough) is heavy handed, but fair. The good flows in rapid succession just like challenges. I feel like if you survive the onslaught, he rewards you with a reasonable term of prosperity, and loves big colonies. He basically fits exactly how I like to play."<br />
"Not sure if I just had bad luck.... But it feels like the game now spams bad events on me."<br />
"Just into my second year in my current game using Rainbeau and I can say, 100%, that he is very fun, even on Some Challenge. XD Very fast paced and intent on being very kind or very brutal to my tiny colony. A+ Storyteller!"<br />
"I've taken to calling this storyteller 'WHAT NOW?!'"<br />
"He looks kinda like Shia Labeouf."</p>

<h1>-- Rainbeau Flambe (dburgdorf) - the modder, not the storyteller ;)</h1>

<p>A Note on Difficulty Levels:</p>

<h1>Technically, Rain can be used at any difficulty setting, if only because there's no way to disable any of those settings. But as a matter of practicality, I wouldn't recommend trying to use him with "base builder" difficulty. Rain utilizes big threats as often as small ones, and tries to keep things going at a fair clip, while the "base builder" setting disables most big threats, and is intended to keep the game moving at a more leisurely pace. The inconsistency should be obvious.</h1>

<p>Compatibility:</p>

<h1>"Rainbeau Flambe - Storyteller" adds a new storyteller, but doesn't really change anything already in the game, so it should be compatible with pretty much any other mod, and you should be able to add it to an existing saved game without trouble. You should also be able to safely remove it from a game in progress, at least so long as Rain's not the currently active storyteller.</h1>

<p>License:</p>

<h1>If you're a modpack maker and want to include this mod in your pack, or if you're a modder and want to use it as the basis of a derivative mod, please feel free to do so. I ask only that you let me know about it.</h1>

<p>Meat can be preserved by drying and smoking it. Smoking meat takes a long time, but you can make a lot simultaneously.<br />
* Smoked meat lasts 2 seasons. It's categorized under MeatRaw, so that it can be used in all recipes that use meat, like meals and kibble.<br />
* The Smoked Meat recipe excludes itself as a possible ingredient, and disables human+insect meat from the ingredients used by default.<br />
* The smokepit is the campfire, modified to use less wood, and more slowly; create much less heat; die faster in the rain; smoke meat.<br />
* The smokehouse allows you to smoke much more meat simultaneously than the smokepit does. The original smokehouse author is Panggul<em>mas, https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=20387.0<br />
* The smokehouse looks funky when you rotate it. Sorry. I'm not artist enough to fix this. Panggul</em>mas's version sets it non-rotatable, but I think sometimes the lay of the land makes that inconvenient, and have sacrificed beauty for function.<br />
* I've made the delay agent on smokehouse-building the requirement for lots of construction materials instead of a Research prerequisite. You can usually get enough stone from deconstructing ruins.<br />

<p>Breed bees to generate all kinds of resources!<br />
<size=24>Features</size><br />
- Beekeeping: find wild bees in all biomes, build beehouses to put them to work! A single beehouse won't do much, so prepare to build a few. Are you in an extreme biome? There are low-efficiency climatized beehouses available for you until you can get bees that modify allowed temperatures!<br />
- Bee breeding: Mix two breeds of bees in a beehouse, and use a brood chamber to multiply them, and an hybridization chamber to get new species (more than 30)!<br />
- Honey making: Centrifuge the combs produced by the bees to get honey and wax.<br />
- Cooking and building: honey can be used as an ingredient in cooking, and wax can be used as a building material.<br />
- Mead brewing: turn honey into mead to make your colonists happy (and drunk)<br />
- Wax lighting: candles are a quaint and cheap way to light your base<br />
- Resource gathering: many of the bees produce combs with more things than honey and wax. Will you find the Luciferium-producing bees?<br />
<size=24>Issues</size><br />
This mod is more complex than other mods I have worked on previously (Genetic Rim and Alpha Animals), so expect some weird issues from time to time. Please report them with an error log if possible.<br />

<p>Adds a larger version of the transport pod to the game.<br />
Maximum load capacity for these pods have been increased to 275kg. Due to the immense size of this monstrosity a small amount of plasteel is required for the construction. However, it still needs only one component, as the control circuitry has largely remained identical to its smaller predecessor.</p>

Each healing operation takes around 6 in game days (8 for destroyed body parts); you will be notified by message when treatment has been finished. Ejecting the patient early will reset treatment progress.<br />
HUGSLIB must be loaded before this mod.<br />
To use:<br />
- Research hospital beds and cryptosleep caskets<br />
- Construct the "regeneration bay" (found in the "misc" category)<br />
--- Note: Advanced components and glitterworld medicine are required for construction<br />
- Select a colonist, right click on the bay, and click "enter regeneration bay"<br />

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541721856">Alpha Animals</a> by Sarg, AFriend, milon, Skullywag and kaptain_kavern</h5>

<p>Adds multiple unique new animals to Rimworld.<br />
<size=24>Features</size><br />
Adds 30 new, vanilla-friendly creatures to the diverse biomes of your Rimworlds. The philosophy of this mod is that every new creatures tries to bring some new mechanic into the game, whether it be walking tanks, living resource farm, indestructible plant monsters, night time stalkers, or plain speedy giant spiders. Some of the mechanics are simple, others much more complex.<br />
These animals will spawn in certain biomes, some others will only be available via traders. You'll have to explore to find them all!<br />
Bear in mind that spawn probabilities have been calculated with no other animal mods installed. If you have, for example, Animal Collab Project, less animals from this mod will appear, obviously.<br />
The mod will also add new insects in a new faction, the Black Hive. Raids from that faction can be disabled via Mod Options.<br />
<size=24>Issues</size><br />
There shouldn't be any. Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.<br />

<p>This mod makes big fluffy white rabbits (hares). This mutant Hare is easily spotted since it is huge and white, possible arising from some strange things involving a rabbit, rum, and a Megasloth. The extra fluff makes them sturdy in the cold and the duller under-fluff can be sheared.  They're strangely bright and can be trained.</p>

<h5><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1556099860">Yorkshire Terrors</a> by kagypoo</h5>

<p>All credit goes to the original author Serpy, all I did was bungle my way through updating the files to (hopefully) get it working properly for 1.0, hope everyone enjoys the big monster terriers.<br />
Original mod:</p>

<h1>https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1404316051</h1>

<p>"A large behemoth of a dog derived from crossbreeding yorkshire terriers with wargs. They are loyal, strong, and have been known to protect their owners to the bitter end."<br />
Yorkshire terrors are similar to wargs in many aspects, except they cannot handle the cold as much as their wargen ancestors can. They are predators and will hunt on their own if not given food directly, and have been seen hunting deer, ibex, boar and even smaller animals. Unlike wargs, they are not restricted to solely eating corpses and kibble (who even thought that was a good idea) and will eat meals, animal products like milk and eggs, and even nutrient paste!</p>

A wild animal intended to add some additional flavor to the game. Really, it is a giraffe; I just named it miraffe as a tip of the cap to the muffalo.<br />

<h2>Version: 1.4.1</h2>

<p><size=20>Description</size><br />
Thanks to the wonders of today's technology, the small group of scientists that was previously known for bringing the Megatherium-<br />
Uh, I mean, the Megasloth back to life, was able to make the Megafauna Project a reality! <br />
This time around, they were able to recreate 38 different species of animals that used to inhabit planet Earth thousands to millions years ago. <br />
...Was that a wise move? Who cares! Now we all can feast our eyes on those glorious beasts as they will slowly inevitably turn all the ecosystems we know upside-down!<br />
<size=20>Features</size><br />
38 new species of animals, all able to spawn naturally in different biomes:<br />
- Arthropleura,<br />
- Doedicurus,<br />
- Daeodon,<br />
- Gigantopithecus,<br />
- Paraceratherium,<br />
- Titanis,<br />
- Titanoboa,<br />
- Woolly Mammoth,<br />
- Elasmotherium,<br />
- Smilodon,<br />
- Chalicotherium,<br />
- Megaloceros,<br />
- Procoptodon,<br />
- Megalania,<br />
- Gomphotaria,<br />
- Diprotodon,<br />
- Short-faced Bear,<br />
- Dinocrocuta,<br />
- Sivatherium,<br />
- Andrewsarchus,<br />
- Dinornis,<br />
- Macrauchenia,<br />
- Quinkana,<br />
- Deinotherium,<br />
- Aurochs,<br />
- Megalochelys,<br />
- Palaeeudyptes,<br />
- Josephoartigasia,<br />
- Gigantophis,<br />
- Meganeura,<br />
- Zygolophodon,<br />
- Platybelodon,<br />
- Purussaurus,<br />
- Uintatherium,<br />
- Pulmonoscorpius,<br />
- Dinopithecus,<br />
- Castoroides,<br />
- Enhydriodon.<br />
These animals are quite rare, and should be a good challenge to either tame or slay. <br />
A lot of them can also be used as pack animals for a caravan (with paraceratherium being your new best caravan buddy!).<br />
Wooly mammoth, elasmotherium, and josephoartigasia are shearable, and arthropleura, titanis, titanoboa, megalania, dinornis, quinkana, megalochelys, palaeeudyptes, gigantophis, meganeura, and purussaurus do lay eggs. Sivatherium, macrauchenia, aurochs cows, and uintatherium are milkable - sivatherium's milk is very nutritious and quite valuable!<br />
Megafauna will automatically detect and patch both A Dog Said... by SpoonShortage and Giddy-up! by Roolo, so make sure to make it load after those mods.<br />

01.11.2018 - Update #5:<br />
- updated to be compatible with Rimworld 1.0,<br />

06.04.2018 - Update #4:<br />
- there is a simple official megafauna wiki now: http://megafaunarimworld.wikia.com!<br />

20.12.2017 - Update #3:<br />

- some of the animals can now spawn in the new swamp-type biomes (titanoboa's no longer exclusive to the tropical rainforest!),<br />
- some of the older animals such as arthropleura and doedicurus now have their own body types instead of using unfitting vanilla ones,<br />
